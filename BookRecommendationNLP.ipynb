                                \n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nWhen on board HMS Beagle as naturalist I was much struck with\ncertain facts in the distribution of the inhabitants of South America and\nin the geological relations of the present to the past inhabitants of that\ncontinent These facts seemed to me to throw some light on the origin of\nspeciesthat mystery of mysteries as it has been called by one of our\ngreatest philosophers On my return home it occurred to me in 1837 that\nsomething might perhaps be made out on this question by patiently\naccumulating and reflecting on all sorts of facts which could possibly have\nany bearing on it After five years work I allowed myself to speculate on\nthe subject and drew up some short notes these I enlarged in 1844 into a\nsketch of the conclusions which then seemed to me probable: from that\nperiod to the present day I have steadily pursued the same object I hope\nthat I may be excused for entering on these personal details as I give\nthem to show that I have not been hasty in coming to a decision\n\nMy work is now nearly finished but as it will take me two or three more\nyears to complete it and as my health is far from strong I have been\nurged to publish this Abstract I have more especially been induced to do\nthis as Mr Wallace who is now studying the 2 natural history of the\nMalay archipelago has arrived at almost exactly the same general\nconclusions that I have on the origin of species Last year he sent me a\nmemoir on this subject with a request that I would forward it to Sir\nCharles Lyell who sent it to the Linnean Society and it is published in\nthe third volume of the Journal of that Society Sir C Lyell and Dr\nHooker who both knew of my workthe latter having read my sketch of\n1844honoured me by thinking it advisable to publish with Mr Wallaces\nexcellent memoir some brief extracts from my manuscripts\n\nThis Abstract which I now publish must necessarily be imperfect I cannot\nhere give references and authorities for my several statements and I must\ntrust to the reader reposing some confidence in my accuracy No doubt\nerrors will have crept in though I hope I have always been cautious in\ntrusting to good authorities alone I can here give only the general\nconclusions at which I have arrived with a few facts in illustration but\nwhich I hope in most cases will suffice No one can feel more sensible\nthan I do of the necessity of hereafter publishing in detail all the facts\nwith references on which my conclusions have been grounded and I hope in\na future work to do this For I am well aware that scarcely a single point\nis discussed in this volume on which facts cannot be adduced often\napparently leading to conclusions directly opposite to those at which I\nhave arrived A fair result can be obtained only by fully stating and\nbalancing the facts and arguments on both sides of each question and this\ncannot possibly be here done\n\nI much regret that want of space prevents my having the satisfaction of\nacknowledging the generous assistance which I have received from very many\nnaturalists some of them personally unknown to me I cannot however 3\nlet this opportunity pass without expressing my deep obligations to Dr\nHooker who for the last fifteen years has aided me in every possible way\nby his large stores of knowledge and his excellent judgment\n\nIn considering the Origin of Species it is quite conceivable that a\nnaturalist reflecting on the mutual affinities of organic beings on their\nembryological relations their geographical distribution geological\nsuccession and other such facts might come to the conclusion that each\nspecies had not been independently created but had descended like\nvarieties from other species Nevertheless such a conclusion even if\nwell founded would be unsatisfactory until it could be shown how the\ninnumerable species inhabiting this world have been modified so as to\nacquire that perfection of structure and coadaptation which most justly\nexcites our admiration Naturalists continually refer to external\nconditions such as climate food c as the only possible cause of\nvariation In one very limited sense as we shall hereafter see this may\nbe true but it is preposterous to attribute to mere external conditions\nthe structure for instance of the woodpecker with its feet tail beak\nand tongue so admirably adapted to catch insects under the bark of trees\nIn the case of the misseltoe which draws its nourishment from certain\ntrees which has seeds that must be transported by certain birds and which\nhas flowers with separate sexes absolutely requiring the agency of certain\ninsects to bring pollen from one flower to the other it is equally\npreposterous to account for the structure of this parasite with its\nrelations to several distinct organic beings by the effects of external\nconditions or of habit or of the volition of the plant itself\n\nThe author of the Vestiges of Creation would I presume say that after\na certain unknown number of 4 generations some bird had given birth to a\nwoodpecker and some plant to the missletoe and that these had been\nproduced perfect as we now see them but this assumption seems to me to be\nno explanation for it leaves the case of the coadaptations of organic\nbeings to each other and to their physical conditions of life untouched\nand unexplained\n\nIt is therefore of the highest importance to gain a clear insight into\nthe means of modification and coadaptation At the commencement of my\nobservations it seemed to me probable that a careful study of domesticated\nanimals and of cultivated plants would offer the best chance of making out\nthis obscure problem Nor have I been disappointed in this and in all\nother perplexing cases I have invariably found that our knowledge\nimperfect though it be of variation under domestication afforded the best\nand safest clue I may venture to express my conviction of the high value\nof such studies although they have been very commonly neglected by\nnaturalists\n\nFrom these considerations I shall devote the first chapter of this\nAbstract to Variation under Domestication We shall thus see that a large\namount of hereditary modification is at least possible and what is\nequally or more important we shall see how great is the power of man in\naccumulating by his Selection successive slight variations I will then\npass on to the variability of species in a state of nature but I shall\nunfortunately be compelled to treat this subject far too briefly as it\ncan be treated properly only by giving long catalogues of facts We shall\nhowever be enabled to discuss what circumstances are most favourable to\nvariation In the next chapter the Struggle for Existence amongst all\norganic beings throughout the world which inevitably follows from the high\ngeometrical ratio of their 5 increase will be treated of This is the\ndoctrine of Malthus applied to the whole animal and vegetable kingdoms As\nmany more individuals of each species are born than can possibly survive\nand as consequently there is a frequently recurring struggle for\nexistence it follows that any being if it vary however slightly in any\nmanner profitable to itself under the complex and sometimes varying\nconditions of life will have a better chance of surviving and thus be\nnaturally selected From the strong principle of inheritance any\nselected variety will tend to propagate its new and modified form\n\nThis fundamental subject of Natural Selection will be treated at some\nlength in the fourth chapter and we shall then see how Natural Selection\nalmost inevitably causes much Extinction of the less improved forms of\nlife and leads to what I have called Divergence of Character In the next\nchapter I shall discuss the complex and little known laws of variation and\nof correlation of growth In the four succeeding chapters the most\napparent and gravest difficulties on the theory will be given: namely\nfirst the difficulties of transitions or in understanding how a simple\nbeing or a simple organ can be changed and perfected into a highly\ndeveloped being or elaborately constructed organ secondly the subject of\nInstinct or the mental powers of animals thirdly Hybridism or the\ninfertility of species and the fertility of varieties when intercrossed\nand fourthly the imperfection of the Geological Record In the next\nchapter I shall consider the geological succession of organic beings\nthroughout time in the eleventh and twelfth their geographical\ndistribution throughout space in the thirteenth their classification or\nmutual affinities both when mature and in an embryonic condition In the\nlast chapter I shall give a 6 brief recapitulation of the whole work and\na few concluding remarks\n\nNo one ought to feel surprise at much remaining as yet unexplained in\nregard to the origin of species and varieties if he makes due allowance\nfor our profound ignorance in regard to the mutual relations of all the\nbeings which live around us Who can explain why one species ranges widely\nand is very numerous and why another allied species has a narrow range and\nis rare Yet these relations are of the highest importance for they\ndetermine the present welfare and as I believe the future success and\nmodification of every inhabitant of this world Still less do we know of\nthe mutual relations of the innumerable inhabitants of the world during the\nmany past geological epochs in its history Although much remains obscure\nand will long remain obscure I can entertain no doubt after the most\ndeliberate study and dispassionate judgment of which I am capable that the\nview which most naturalists entertain and which I formerly\nentertainednamely that each species has been independently createdis\nerroneous I am fully convinced that species are not immutable but that\nthose belonging to what are called the same genera are lineal descendants\nof some other and generally extinct species in the same manner as the\nacknowledged varieties of any one species are the descendants of that\nspecies Furthermore I am convinced that Natural Selection has been the\nmain but not exclusive means of modification\n\n                                   \n\n\n7\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nVARIATION UNDER DOMESTICATION\n\n    Causes of VariabilityEffects of HabitCorrelation of\n    GrowthInheritanceCharacter of Domestic VarietiesDifficulty of\n    distinguishing between Varieties and SpeciesOrigin of Domestic\n    Varieties from one or more SpeciesDomestic Pigeons their Differences\n    and OriginPrinciple of Selection anciently followed its\n    EffectsMethodical and Unconscious SelectionUnknown Origin of our\n    Domestic ProductionsCircumstances favourable to Mans power of\n    Selection\n\nWhen we look to the individuals of the same variety or subvariety of our\nolder cultivated plants and animals one of the first points which strikes\nus is that they generally differ more from each other than do the\nindividuals of any one species or variety in a state of nature When we\nreflect on the vast diversity of the plants and animals which have been\ncultivated and which have varied during all ages under the most different\nclimates and treatment I think we are driven to conclude that this great\nvariability is simply due to our domestic productions having been raised\nunder conditions of life not so uniform as and somewhat different from\nthose to which the parentspecies have been exposed under nature There is\nalso I think some probability in the view propounded by Andrew Knight\nthat this variability may be partly connected with excess of food It seems\npretty clear that organic beings must be exposed during several generations\nto the new conditions of life to cause any appreciable amount of variation\nand that when the organisation has once begun to vary it generally\ncontinues to vary for many generations 8 No case is on record of a\nvariable being ceasing to be variable under cultivation Our oldest\ncultivated plants such as wheat still often yield new varieties: our\noldest domesticated animals are still capable of rapid improvement or\nmodification\n\nIt has been disputed at what period of life the causes of variability\nwhatever they may be generally act whether during the early or late\nperiod of development of the embryo or at the instant of conception\nGeoffroy St Hilaires experiments show that unnatural treatment of the\nembryo causes monstrosities and monstrosities cannot be separated by any\nclear line of distinction from mere variations But I am strongly inclined\nto suspect that the most frequent cause of variability may be attributed to\nthe male and female reproductive elements having been affected prior to the\nact of conception Several reasons make me believe in this but the chief\none is the remarkable effect which confinement or cultivation has on the\nfunction of the reproductive system this system appearing to be far more\nsusceptible than any other part of the organisation to the action of any\nchange in the conditions of life Nothing is more easy than to tame an\nanimal and few things more difficult than to get it to breed freely under\nconfinement even in the many cases when the male and female unite How\nmany animals there are which will not breed though living long under not\nvery close confinement in their native country This is generally\nattributed to vitiated instincts but how many cultivated plants display\nthe utmost vigour and yet rarely or never seed In some few such cases it\nhas been discovered that very trifling changes such as a little more or\nless water at some particular period of growth will determine whether or\nnot the plant sets a seed I cannot here enter on the copious details which\nI have collected on 9 this curious subject but to show how singular the\nlaws are which determine the reproduction of animals under confinement I\nmay just mention that carnivorous animals even from the tropics breed in\nthis country pretty freely under confinement with the exception of the\nplantigrades or bear family whereas carnivorous birds with the rarest\nexceptions hardly ever lay fertile eggs Many exotic plants have pollen\nutterly worthless in the same exact condition as in the most sterile\nhybrids When on the one hand we see domesticated animals and plants\nthough often weak and sickly yet breeding quite freely under confinement\nand when on the other hand we see individuals though taken young from a\nstate of nature perfectly tamed longlived and healthy of which I could\ngive numerous instances yet having their reproductive system so seriously\naffected by unperceived causes as to fail in acting we need not be\nsurprised at this system when it does act under confinement acting not\nquite regularly and producing offspring not perfectly like their parents\n\nSterility has been said to be the bane of horticulture but on this view we\nowe variability to the same cause which produces sterility and variability\nis the source of all the choicest productions of the garden I may add\nthat as some organisms will breed freely under the most unnatural\nconditions for instance the rabbit and ferret kept in hutches showing\nthat their reproductive system has not been thus affected so will some\nanimals and plants withstand domestication or cultivation and vary very\nslightlyperhaps hardly more than in a state of nature\n\nA long list could easily be given of sporting plants by this term\ngardeners mean a single bud or offset which suddenly assumes a new and\nsometimes very different character from that of the rest of the plant 10\nSuch buds can be propagated by grafting c and sometimes by seed These\nsports are extremely rare under nature but far from rare under\ncultivation and in this case we see that the treatment of the parent has\naffected a bud or offset and not the ovules or pollen But it is the\nopinion of most physiologists that there is no essential difference between\na bud and an ovule in their earliest stages of formation so that in fact\nsports support my view that variability may be largely attributed to the\novules or pollen or to both having been affected by the treatment of the\nparent prior to the act of conception These cases anyhow show that\nvariation is not necessarily connected as some authors have supposed with\nthe act of generation\n\nSeedlings from the same fruit and the young of the same litter sometimes\ndiffer considerably from each other though both the young and the parents\nas Mller has remarked have apparently been exposed to exactly the same\nconditions of life and this shows how unimportant the direct effects of\nthe conditions of life are in comparison with the laws of reproduction of\ngrowth and of inheritance for had the action of the conditions been\ndirect if any of the young had varied all would probably have varied in\nthe same manner To judge how much in the case of any variation we should\nattribute to the direct action of heat moisture light food c is most\ndifficult: my impression is that with animals such agencies have produced\nvery little direct effect though apparently more in the case of plants\nUnder this point of view Mr Buckmans recent experiments on plants are\nextremely valuable When all or nearly all the individuals exposed to\ncertain conditions are affected in the same way the change at first\nappears to be directly due to such conditions but in some cases it can be\nshown that quite opposite conditions produce 11 similar changes of\nstructure Nevertheless some slight amount of change may I think be\nattributed to the direct action of the conditions of lifeas in some\ncases increased size from amount of food colour from particular kinds of\nfood or from light and perhaps the thickness of fur from climate\n\nHabit also has a decided influence as in the period of flowering with\nplants when transported from one climate to another In animals it has a\nmore marked effect for instance I find in the domestic duck that the\nbones of the wing weigh less and the bones of the leg more in proportion\nto the whole skeleton than do the same bones in the wildduck and I\npresume that this change may be safely attributed to the domestic duck\nflying much less and walking more than its wild parent The great and\ninherited development of the udders in cows and goats in countries where\nthey are habitually milked in comparison with the state of these organs in\nother countries is another instance of the effect of use Not a single\ndomestic animal can be named which has not in some country drooping ears\nand the view suggested by some authors that the drooping is due to the\ndisuse of the muscles of the ear from the animals not being much alarmed\nby danger seems probable\n\nThere are many laws regulating variation some few of which can be dimly\nseen and will be hereafter briefly mentioned I will here only allude to\nwhat may be called correlation of growth Any change in the embryo or larva\nwill almost certainly entail changes in the mature animal In\nmonstrosities the correlations between quite distinct parts are very\ncurious and many instances are given in Isidore Geoffroy St Hilaires\ngreat work on this subject Breeders believe that long limbs are almost\nalways accompanied by an elongated head Some instances of correlation are\nquite whimsical: thus 12 cats with blue eyes are invariably deaf colour\nand constitutional peculiarities go together of which many remarkable\ncases could be given amongst animals and plants From the facts collected\nby Heusinger it appears that white sheep and pigs are differently affected\nfrom coloured individuals by certain vegetable poisons Hairless dogs have\nimperfect teeth: longhaired and coarsehaired animals are apt to have as\nis asserted long or many horns pigeons with feathered feet have skin\nbetween their outer toes pigeons with short beaks have small feet and\nthose with long beaks large feet Hence if man goes on selecting and thus\naugmenting any peculiarity he will almost certainly unconsciously modify\nother parts of the structure owing to the mysterious laws of the\ncorrelation of growth\n\nThe result of the various quite unknown or dimly seen laws of variation\nis infinitely complex and diversified It is well worth while carefully to\nstudy the several treatises published on some of our old cultivated plants\nas on the hyacinth potato even the dahlia c and it is really\nsurprising to note the endless points in structure and constitution in\nwhich the varieties and subvarieties differ slightly from each other The\nwhole organisation seems to have become plastic and tends to depart in\nsome small degree from that of the parental type\n\nAny variation which is not inherited is unimportant for us But the number\nand diversity of inheritable deviations of structure both those of slight\nand those of considerable physiological importance is endless Dr Prosper\nLucass treatise in two large volumes is the fullest and the best on this\nsubject No breeder doubts how strong is the tendency to inheritance: like\nproduces like is his fundamental belief: doubts have been thrown on this\nprinciple by theoretical writers alone When any deviation of structure\noften appears and we see it in the 13 father and child we cannot tell\nwhether it may not be due to the same cause having acted on both but when\namongst individuals apparently exposed to the same conditions any very\nrare deviation due to some extraordinary combination of circumstances\nappears in the parentsay once amongst several million individualsand\nit reappears in the child the mere doctrine of chances almost compels us\nto attribute its reappearance to inheritance Every one must have heard of\ncases of albinism prickly skin hairy bodies c appearing in several\nmembers of the same family If strange and rare deviations of structure are\ntruly inherited less strange and commoner deviations may be freely\nadmitted to be inheritable Perhaps the correct way of viewing the whole\nsubject would be to look at the inheritance of every character whatever\nas the rule and noninheritance as the anomaly\n\nThe laws governing inheritance are quite unknown no one can say why a\npeculiarity in different individuals of the same species or in individuals\nof different species is sometimes inherited and sometimes not so why the\nchild often reverts in certain characters to its grandfather or grandmother\nor other more remote ancestor why a peculiarity is often transmitted from\none sex to both sexes or to one sex alone more commonly but not\nexclusively to the like sex It is a fact of some little importance to us\nthat peculiarities appearing in the males of our domestic breeds are often\ntransmitted either exclusively or in a much greater degree to males\nalone A much more important rule which I think may be trusted is that\nat whatever period of life a peculiarity first appears it tends to appear\nin the offspring at a corresponding age though sometimes earlier In many\ncases this could not be otherwise: thus the inherited peculiarities in the\nhorns of cattle could appear only in 14 the offspring when nearly mature\npeculiarities in the silkworm are known to appear at the corresponding\ncaterpillar or cocoon stage But hereditary diseases and some other facts\nmake me believe that the rule has a wider extension and that when there is\nno apparent reason why a peculiarity should appear at any particular age\nyet that it does tend to appear in the offspring at the same period at\nwhich it first appeared in the parent I believe this rule to be of the\nhighest importance in explaining the laws of embryology These remarks are\nof course confined to the first appearance of the peculiarity and not to\nits primary cause which may have acted on the ovules or male element in\nnearly the same manner as in the crossed offspring from a shorthorned cow\nby a longhorned bull the greater length of horn though appearing late in\nlife is clearly due to the male element\n\nHaving alluded to the subject of reversion I may here refer to a statement\noften made by naturalistsnamely that our domestic varieties when run\nwild gradually but certainly revert in character to their aboriginal\nstocks Hence it has been argued that no deductions can be drawn from\ndomestic races to species in a state of nature I have in vain endeavoured\nto discover on what decisive facts the above statement has so often and so\nboldly been made There would be great difficulty in proving its truth: we\nmay safely conclude that very many of the most stronglymarked domestic\nvarieties could not possibly live in a wild state In many cases we do not\nknow what the aboriginal stock was and so could not tell whether or not\nnearly perfect reversion had ensued It would be quite necessary in order\nto prevent the effects of intercrossing that only a single variety should\nbe turned loose in its new home Nevertheless as our varieties certainly\ndo occasionally 15 revert in some of their characters to ancestral forms\nit seems to me not improbable that if we could succeed in naturalising or\nwere to cultivate during many generations the several races for\ninstance of the cabbage in very poor soil in which case however some\neffect would have to be attributed to the direct action of the poor soil\nthat they would to a large extent or even wholly revert to the wild\naboriginal stock Whether or not the experiment would succeed is not of\ngreat importance for our line of argument for by the experiment itself the\nconditions of life are changed If it could be shown that our domestic\nvarieties manifested a strong tendency to reversionthat is to lose\ntheir acquired characters whilst kept under the same conditions and\nwhilst kept in a considerable body so that free intercrossing might check\nby blending together any slight deviations in their structure in such\ncase I grant that we could deduce nothing from domestic varieties in\nregard to species But there is not a shadow of evidence in favour of this\nview: to assert that we could not breed our cart and racehorses long and\nshorthorned cattle and poultry of various breeds and esculent\nvegetables for an almost infinite number of generations would be opposed\nto all experience I may add that when under nature the conditions of life\ndo change variations and reversions of character probably do occur but\nnatural selection as will hereafter be explained will determine how far\nthe new characters thus arising shall be preserved\n\nWhen we look to the hereditary varieties or races of our domestic animals\nand plants and compare them with closely allied species we generally\nperceive in each domestic race as already remarked less uniformity of\ncharacter than in true species Domestic races of the same species also\noften have a somewhat monstrous character by which I mean that although\ndiffering 16 from each other and from other species of the same genus\nin several trifling respects they often differ in an extreme degree in\nsome one part both when compared one with another and more especially\nwhen compared with all the species in nature to which they are nearest\nallied With these exceptions and with that of the perfect fertility of\nvarieties when crosseda subject hereafter to be discussed domestic\nraces of the same species differ from each other in the same manner as\nonly in most cases in a lesser degree than do closelyallied species of\nthe same genus in a state of nature I think this must be admitted when we\nfind that there are hardly any domestic races either amongst animals or\nplants which have not been ranked by competent judges as mere varieties\nand by other competent judges as the descendants of aboriginally distinct\nspecies If any marked distinction existed between domestic races and\nspecies this source of doubt could not so perpetually recur It has often\nbeen stated that domestic races do not differ from each other in characters\nof generic value I think it could be shown that this statement is hardly\ncorrect but naturalists differ widely in determining what characters are\nof generic value all such valuations being at present empirical Moreover\non the view of the origin of genera which I shall presently give we have\nno right to expect often to meet with generic differences in our\ndomesticated productions\n\nWhen we attempt to estimate the amount of structural difference between the\ndomestic races of the same species we are soon involved in doubt from not\nknowing whether they have descended from one or several parentspecies\nThis point if it could be cleared up would be interesting if for\ninstance it could be shown that the greyhound bloodhound terrier\nspaniel and bulldog which we all know propagate their kind so truly\nwere the 17 offspring of any single species then such facts would have\ngreat weight in making us doubt about the immutability of the many very\nclosely allied natural speciesfor instance of the many foxesinhabiting\ndifferent quarters of the world I do not believe as we shall presently\nsee that the whole amount of difference between the several breeds of the\ndog has been produced under domestication I believe that some small part\nof the difference is due to their being descended from distinct species In\nthe case of some other domesticated species there is presumptive or even\nstrong evidence that all the breeds have descended from a single wild\nstock\n\nIt has often been assumed that man has chosen for domestication animals and\nplants having an extraordinary inherent tendency to vary and likewise to\nwithstand diverse climates I do not dispute that these capacities have\nadded largely to the value of most of our domesticated productions but how\ncould a savage possibly know when he first tamed an animal whether it\nwould vary in succeeding generations and whether it would endure other\nclimates Has the little variability of the ass or guineafowl or the\nsmall power of endurance of warmth by the reindeer or of cold by the\ncommon camel prevented their domestication I cannot doubt that if other\nanimals and plants equal in number to our domesticated productions and\nbelonging to equally diverse classes and countries were taken from a state\nof nature and could be made to breed for an equal number of generations\nunder domestication they would vary on an average as largely as the parent\nspecies of our existing domesticated productions have varied\n\nIn the case of most of our anciently domesticated animals and plants I do\nnot think it is possible to come to any definite conclusion whether they\nhave descended from one or several wild species The argument mainly relied\non by those who believe in the multiple origin 18 of our domestic animals\nis that we find in the most ancient records more especially on the\nmonuments of Egypt much diversity in the breeds and that some of the\nbreeds closely resemble perhaps are identical with those still existing\nEven if this latter fact were found more strictly and generally true than\nseems to me to be the case what does it show but that some of our breeds\noriginated there four or five thousand years ago But Mr Horners\nresearches have rendered it in some degree probable that man sufficiently\ncivilized to have manufactured pottery existed in the valley of the Nile\nthirteen or fourteen thousand years ago and who will pretend to say how\nlong before these ancient periods savages like those of Tierra del Fuego\nor Australia who possess a semidomestic dog may not have existed in\nEgypt\n\nThe whole subject must I think remain vague nevertheless I may without\nhere entering on any details state that from geographical and other\nconsiderations I think it highly probable that our domestic dogs have\ndescended from several wild species Knowing as we do that savages are\nvery fond of taming animals it seems to me unlikely in the case of the\ndoggenus which is distributed in a wild state throughout the world that\nsince man first appeared one single species alone should have been\ndomesticated In regard to sheep and goats I can form no opinion I should\nthink from facts communicated to me by Mr Blyth on the habits voice\nand constitution c of the humped Indian cattle that these had\ndescended from a different aboriginal stock from our European cattle and\nseveral competent judges believe that these latter have had more than one\nwild parent With respect to horses from reasons which I cannot give here\nI am doubtfully inclined to believe in opposition to several authors that\nall the races have descended from one 19 wild stock Mr Blyth whose\nopinion from his large and varied stores of knowledge I should value more\nthan that of almost any one thinks that all the breeds of poultry have\nproceeded from the common wild Indian fowl Gallus bankiva In regard to\nducks and rabbits the breeds of which differ considerably from each other\nin structure I do not doubt that they have all descended from the common\nwild duck and rabbit\n\nThe doctrine of the origin of our several domestic races from several\naboriginal stocks has been carried to an absurd extreme by some authors\nThey believe that every race which breeds true let the distinctive\ncharacters be ever so slight has had its wild prototype At this rate\nthere must have existed at least a score of species of wild cattle as many\nsheep and several goats in Europe alone and several even within Great\nBritain One author believes that there formerly existed in Great Britain\neleven wild species of sheep peculiar to it When we bear in mind that\nBritain has now hardly one peculiar mammal and France but few distinct\nfrom those of Germany and conversely and so with Hungary Spain c but\nthat each of these kingdoms possesses several peculiar breeds of cattle\nsheep c we must admit that many domestic breeds have originated in\nEurope for whence could they have been derived as these several countries\ndo not possess a number of peculiar species as distinct parentstocks So\nit is in India Even in the case of the domestic dogs of the whole world\nwhich I fully admit have probably descended from several wild species I\ncannot doubt that there has been an immense amount of inherited variation\nWho can believe that animals closely resembling the Italian greyhound the\nbloodhound the bulldog or Blenheim spaniel cso unlike all wild\nCanidever existed freely in a state of nature It has often been loosely\nsaid that all our races of dogs have 20 been produced by the crossing of\na few aboriginal species but by crossing we can only get forms in some\ndegree intermediate between their parents and if we account for our\nseveral domestic races by this process we must admit the former existence\nof the most extreme forms as the Italian greyhound bloodhound bulldog\nc in the wild state Moreover the possibility of making distinct races\nby crossing has been greatly exaggerated There can be no doubt that a race\nmay be modified by occasional crosses if aided by the careful selection of\nthose individual mongrels which present any desired character but that a\nrace could be obtained nearly intermediate between two extremely different\nraces or species I can hardly believe Sir J Sebright expressly\nexperimentised for this object and failed The offspring from the first\ncross between two pure breeds is tolerably and sometimes as I have found\nwith pigeons extremely uniform and everything seems simple enough but\nwhen these mongrels are crossed one with another for several generations\nhardly two of them will be alike and then the extreme difficulty or\nrather utter hopelessness of the task becomes apparent Certainly a breed\nintermediate between two very distinct breeds could not be got without\nextreme care and longcontinued selection nor can I find a single case on\nrecord of a permanent race having been thus formed\n\nOn the Breeds of the Domestic PigeonBelieving that it is always best\nto study some special group I have after deliberation taken up domestic\npigeons I have kept every breed which I could purchase or obtain and have\nbeen most kindly favoured with skins from several quarters of the world\nmore especially by the Hon W Elliot from India and by the Hon C Murray\nfrom Persia Many treatises in different languages have been published on\npigeons and some of them are very important as being of 21 considerable\nantiquity I have associated with several eminent fanciers and have been\npermitted to join two of the London Pigeon Clubs The diversity of the\nbreeds is something astonishing Compare the English carrier and the\nshortfaced tumbler and see the wonderful difference in their beaks\nentailing corresponding differences in their skulls The carrier more\nespecially the male bird is also remarkable from the wonderful development\nof the carunculated skin about the head and this is accompanied by greatly\nelongated eyelids very large external orifices to the nostrils and a wide\ngape of mouth The shortfaced tumbler has a beak in outline almost like\nthat of a finch and the common tumbler has the singular inherited habit of\nflying at a great height in a compact flock and tumbling in the air head\nover heels The runt is a bird of great size with long massive beak and\nlarge feet some of the subbreeds of runts have very long necks others\nvery long wings and tails others singularly short tails The barb is\nallied to the carrier but instead of a very long beak has a very short\nand very broad one The pouter has a much elongated body wings and legs\nand its enormously developed crop which it glories in inflating may well\nexcite astonishment and even laughter The turbit has a very short and\nconical beak with a line of reversed feathers down the breast and it has\nthe habit of continually expanding slightly the upper part of the\noesophagus The Jacobin has the feathers so much reversed along the back of\nthe neck that they form a hood and it has proportionally to its size\nmuch elongated wing and tail feathers The trumpeter and laugher as their\nnames express utter a very different coo from the other breeds The\nfantail has thirty or even forty tail feathers instead of twelve or\nfourteen the normal number in all members of the great pigeon family and\nthese feathers are kept expanded and are 22 carried so erect that in\ngood birds the head and tail touch the oilgland is quite aborted Several\nother less distinct breeds might be specified\n\nIn the skeletons of the several breeds the development of the bones of the\nface in length and breadth and curvature differs enormously The shape as\nwell as the breadth and length of the ramus of the lower jaw varies in a\nhighly remarkable manner The number of the caudal and sacral vertebr\nvary as does the number of the ribs together with their relative breadth\nand the presence of processes The size and shape of the apertures in the\nsternum are highly variable so is the degree of divergence and relative\nsize of the two arms of the furcula The proportional width of the gape of\nmouth the proportional length of the eyelids of the orifice of the\nnostrils of the tongue not always in strict correlation with the length\nof beak the size of the crop and of the upper part of the oesophagus the\ndevelopment and abortion of the oilgland the number of the primary wing\nand caudal feathers the relative length of wing and tail to each other and\nto the body the relative length of leg and of the feet the number of\nscutell on the toes the development of skin between the toes are all\npoints of structure which are variable The period at which the perfect\nplumage is acquired varies as does the state of the down with which the\nnestling birds are clothed when hatched The shape and size of the eggs\nvary The manner of flight differs remarkably as does in some breeds the\nvoice and disposition Lastly in certain breeds the males and females\nhave come to differ to a slight degree from each other\n\nAltogether at least a score of pigeons might be chosen which if shown to\nan ornithologist and he were told that they were wild birds would\ncertainly I think be ranked by him as welldefined species Moreover I\ndo not believe that any ornithologist would place the 23 English carrier\nthe shortfaced tumbler the runt the barb pouter and fantail in the\nsame genus more especially as in each of these breeds several\ntrulyinherited subbreeds or species as he might have called them could\nbe shown him\n\nGreat as the differences are between the breeds of pigeons I am fully\nconvinced that the common opinion of naturalists is correct namely that\nall have descended from the rockpigeon Columba livia including under\nthis term several geographical races or subspecies which differ from each\nother in the most trifling respects As several of the reasons which have\nled me to this belief are in some degree applicable in other cases I will\nhere briefly give them If the several breeds are not varieties and have\nnot proceeded from the rockpigeon they must have descended from at least\nseven or eight aboriginal stocks for it is impossible to make the present\ndomestic breeds by the crossing of any lesser number: how for instance\ncould a pouter be produced by crossing two breeds unless one of the\nparentstocks possessed the characteristic enormous crop The supposed\naboriginal stocks must all have been rockpigeons that is not breeding or\nwillingly perching on trees But besides C livia with its geographical\nsubspecies only two or three other species of rockpigeons are known and\nthese have not any of the characters of the domestic breeds Hence the\nsupposed aboriginal stocks must either still exist in the countries where\nthey were originally domesticated and yet be unknown to ornithologists\nand this considering their size habits and remarkable characters seems\nvery improbable or they must have become extinct in the wild state But\nbirds breeding on precipices and good fliers are unlikely to be\nexterminated and the common rockpigeon which has the same habits with\nthe domestic breeds has not been exterminated 24 even on several of the\nsmaller British islets or on the shores of the Mediterranean Hence the\nsupposed extermination of so many species having similar habits with the\nrockpigeon seems to me a very rash assumption Moreover the several\nabovenamed domesticated breeds have been transported to all parts of the\nworld and therefore some of them must have been carried back again into\ntheir native country but not one has ever become wild or feral though the\ndovecotpigeon which is the rockpigeon in a very slightly altered state\nhas become feral in several places Again all recent experience shows that\nit is most difficult to get any wild animal to breed freely under\ndomestication yet on the hypothesis of the multiple origin of our pigeons\nit must be assumed that at least seven or eight species were so thoroughly\ndomesticated in ancient times by halfcivilized man as to be quite\nprolific under confinement\n\nAn argument as it seems to me of great weight and applicable in several\nother cases is that the abovespecified breeds though agreeing generally\nin constitution habits voice colouring and in most parts of their\nstructure with the wild rockpigeon yet are certainly highly abnormal in\nother parts of their structure we may look in vain throughout the whole\ngreat family of Columbid for a beak like that of the English carrier or\nthat of the shortfaced tumbler or barb for reversed feathers like those\nof the Jacobin for a crop like that of the pouter for tailfeathers like\nthose of the fantail Hence it must be assumed not only that halfcivilized\nman succeeded in thoroughly domesticating several species but that he\nintentionally or by chance picked out extraordinarily abnormal species and\nfurther that these very species have since all become extinct or unknown\nSo many strange contingencies seem to me improbable in the highest degree\n25\n\nSome facts in regard to the colouring of pigeons well deserve\nconsideration The rockpigeon is of a slatyblue and has a white rump\nthe Indian subspecies C intermedia of Strickland having it bluish the\ntail has a terminal dark bar with the bases of the outer feathers\nexternally edged with white the wings have two black bars some\nsemidomestic breeds and some apparently truly wild breeds have besides\nthe two black bars the wings chequered with black These several marks do\nnot occur together in any other species of the whole family Now in every\none of the domestic breeds taking thoroughly wellbred birds all the\nabove marks even to the white edging of the outer tailfeathers sometimes\nconcur perfectly developed Moreover when two birds belonging to two\ndistinct breeds are crossed neither of which is blue or has any of the\nabovespecified marks the mongrel offspring are very apt suddenly to\nacquire these characters for instance I crossed some uniformly white\nfantails with some uniformly black barbs and they produced mottled brown\nand black birds these I again crossed together and one grandchild of the\npure white fantail and pure black barb was of as beautiful a blue colour\nwith the white rump double black wingbar and barred and whiteedged\ntailfeathers as any wild rockpigeon We can understand these facts on\nthe wellknown principle of reversion to ancestral characters if all the\ndomestic breeds have descended from the rockpigeon But if we deny this\nwe must make one of the two following highly improbable suppositions\nEither firstly that all the several imagined aboriginal stocks were\ncoloured and marked like the rockpigeon although no other existing\nspecies is thus coloured and marked so that in each separate breed there\nmight be a tendency to revert to the very same colours and markings Or\nsecondly 26 that each breed even the purest has within a dozen or at\nmost within a score of generations been crossed by the rockpigeon: I say\nwithin a dozen or twenty generations for we know of no fact countenancing\nthe belief that the child ever reverts to some one ancestor removed by a\ngreater number of generations In a breed which has been crossed only once\nwith some distinct breed the tendency to reversion to any character\nderived from such cross will naturally become less and less as in each\nsucceeding generation there will be less of the foreign blood but when\nthere has been no cross with a distinct breed and there is a tendency in\nboth parents to revert to a character which has been lost during some\nformer generation this tendency for all that we can see to the contrary\nmay be transmitted undiminished for an indefinite number of generations\nThese two distinct cases are often confounded in treatises on inheritance\n\nLastly the hybrids or mongrels from between all the domestic breeds of\npigeons are perfectly fertile I can state this from my own observations\npurposely made on the most distinct breeds Now it is difficult perhaps\nimpossible to bring forward one case of the hybrid offspring of two\nanimals clearly distinct being themselves perfectly fertile Some authors\nbelieve that longcontinued domestication eliminates this strong tendency\nto sterility: from the history of the dog I think there is some probability\nin this hypothesis if applied to species closely related together though\nit is unsupported by a single experiment But to extend the hypothesis so\nfar as to suppose that species aboriginally as distinct as carriers\ntumblers pouters and fantails now are should yield offspring perfectly\nfertile inter se seems to me rash in the extreme\n\nFrom these several reasons namely the improbability of man having\nformerly got seven or eight supposed 27 species of pigeons to breed\nfreely under domestication these supposed species being quite unknown in a\nwild state and their becoming nowhere feral these species having very\nabnormal characters in certain respects as compared with all other\nColumbid though so like in most other respects to the rockpigeon the\nblue colour and various marks occasionally appearing in all the breeds\nboth when kept pure and when crossed the mongrel offspring being perfectly\nfertilefrom these several reasons taken together I can feel no doubt\nthat all our domestic breeds have descended from the Columba livia with its\ngeographical subspecies\n\nIn favour of this view I may add firstly that C livia or the\nrockpigeon has been found capable of domestication in Europe and in\nIndia and that it agrees in habits and in a great number of points of\nstructure with all the domestic breeds Secondly although an English\ncarrier or shortfaced tumbler differs immensely in certain characters from\nthe rockpigeon yet by comparing the several subbreeds of these\nvarieties more especially those brought from distant countries we can\nmake an almost perfect series between the extremes of structure Thirdly\nthose characters which are mainly distinctive of each breed for instance\nthe wattle and length of beak of the carrier the shortness of that of the\ntumbler and the number of tailfeathers in the fantail are in each breed\neminently variable and the explanation of this fact will be obvious when\nwe come to treat of selection Fourthly pigeons have been watched and\ntended with the utmost care and loved by many people They have been\ndomesticated for thousands of years in several quarters of the world the\nearliest known record of pigeons is in the fifth gyptian dynasty about\n3000 BC as was pointed out to me by Professor Lepsius but Mr Birch\ninforms me that pigeons are given in a bill 28 of fare in the previous\ndynasty In the time of the Romans as we hear from Pliny immense prices\nwere given for pigeons nay they are come to this pass that they can\nreckon up their pedigree and race Pigeons were much valued by Akber Khan\nin India about the year 1600 never less than 20000 pigeons were taken\nwith the court The monarchs of Iran and Turan sent him some very rare\nbirds and continues the courtly historian His Majesty by crossing the\nbreeds which method was never practised before has improved them\nastonishingly About this same period the Dutch were as eager about\npigeons as were the old Romans The paramount importance of these\nconsiderations in explaining the immense amount of variation which pigeons\nhave undergone will be obvious when we treat of Selection We shall then\nalso see how it is that the breeds so often have a somewhat monstrous\ncharacter It is also a most favourable circumstance for the production of\ndistinct breeds that male and female pigeons can be easily mated for life\nand thus different breeds can be kept together in the same aviary\n\nI have discussed the probable origin of domestic pigeons at some yet quite\ninsufficient length because when I first kept pigeons and watched the\nseveral kinds knowing well how true they bred I felt fully as much\ndifficulty in believing that they could have descended from a common\nparent as any naturalist could in coming to a similar conclusion in regard\nto the many species of finches or other large groups of birds in nature\nOne circumstance has struck me much namely that all the breeders of the\nvarious domestic animals and the cultivators of plants with whom I have\never conversed or whose treatises I have read are firmly convinced that\nthe several breeds to which each has attended are descended from so many\naboriginally distinct species 29 Ask as I have asked a celebrated\nraiser of Hereford cattle whether his cattle might not have descended from\nlonghorns and he will laugh you to scorn I have never met a pigeon or\npoultry or duck or rabbit fancier who was not fully convinced that each\nmain breed was descended from a distinct species Van Mons in his treatise\non pears and apples shows how utterly he disbelieves that the several\nsorts for instance a Ribstonpippin or Codlinapple could ever have\nproceeded from the seeds of the same tree Innumerable other examples could\nbe given The explanation I think is simple: from longcontinued study\nthey are strongly impressed with the differences between the several races\nand though they well know that each race varies slightly for they win\ntheir prizes by selecting such slight differences yet they ignore all\ngeneral arguments and refuse to sum up in their minds slight differences\naccumulated during many successive generations May not those naturalists\nwho knowing far less of the laws of inheritance than does the breeder and\nknowing no more than he does of the intermediate links in the long lines of\ndescent yet admit that many of our domestic races have descended from the\nsame parentsmay they not learn a lesson of caution when they deride the\nidea of species in a state of nature being lineal descendants of other\nspecies\n\nSelectionLet us now briefly consider the steps by which domestic races\nhave been produced either from one or from several allied species Some\nlittle effect may perhaps be attributed to the direct action of the\nexternal conditions of life and some little to habit but he would be a\nbold man who would account by such agencies for the differences of a dray\nand race horse a greyhound and bloodhound a carrier and tumbler pigeon\nOne of the most remarkable features in our domesticated races 30 is that\nwe see in them adaptation not indeed to the animals or plants own good\nbut to mans use or fancy Some variations useful to him have probably\narisen suddenly or by one step many botanists for instance believe that\nthe fullers teazle with its hooks which cannot be rivalled by any\nmechanical contrivance is only a variety of the wild Dipsacus and this\namount of change may have suddenly arisen in a seedling So it has probably\nbeen with the turnspit dog and this is known to have been the case with\nthe ancon sheep But when we compare the drayhorse and racehorse the\ndromedary and camel the various breeds of sheep fitted either for\ncultivated land or mountain pasture with the wool of one breed good for\none purpose and that of another breed for another purpose when we compare\nthe many breeds of dogs each good for man in very different ways when we\ncompare the gamecock so pertinacious in battle with other breeds so\nlittle quarrelsome with everlasting layers which never desire to sit\nand with the bantam so small and elegant when we compare the host of\nagricultural culinary orchard and flowergarden races of plants most\nuseful to man at different seasons and for different purposes or so\nbeautiful in his eyes we must I think look further than to mere\nvariability We cannot suppose that all the breeds were suddenly produced\nas perfect and as useful as we now see them indeed in several cases we\nknow that this has not been their history The key is mans power of\naccumulative selection: nature gives successive variations man adds them\nup in certain directions useful to him In this sense he may be said to\nmake for himself useful breeds\n\nThe great power of this principle of selection is not hypothetical It is\ncertain that several of our eminent breeders have even within a single\nlifetime modified to 31 a large extent some breeds of cattle and sheep\nIn order fully to realise what they have done it is almost necessary to\nread several of the many treatises devoted to this subject and to inspect\nthe animals Breeders habitually speak of an animals organisation as\nsomething quite plastic which they can model almost as they please If I\nhad space I could quote numerous passages to this effect from highly\ncompetent authorities Youatt who was probably better acquainted with the\nworks of agriculturists than almost any other individual and who was\nhimself a very good judge of an animal speaks of the principle of\nselection as that which enables the agriculturist not only to modify the\ncharacter of his flock but to change it altogether It is the magicians\nwand by means of which he may summon into life whatever form and mould he\npleases Lord Somerville speaking of what breeders have done for sheep\nsays:It would seem as if they had chalked out upon a wall a form perfect\nin itself and then had given it existence That most skilful breeder Sir\nJohn Sebright used to say with respect to pigeons that he would produce\nany given feather in three years but it would take him six years to obtain\nhead and beak In Saxony the importance of the principle of selection in\nregard to merino sheep is so fully recognised that men follow it as a\ntrade: the sheep are placed on a table and are studied like a picture by a\nconnoisseur this is done three times at intervals of months and the sheep\nare each time marked and classed so that the very best may ultimately be\nselected for breeding\n\nWhat English breeders have actually effected is proved by the enormous\nprices given for animals with a good pedigree and these have now been\nexported to almost every quarter of the world The improvement is by no\nmeans generally due to crossing different breeds 32 all the best\nbreeders are strongly opposed to this practice except sometimes amongst\nclosely allied subbreeds And when a cross has been made the closest\nselection is far more indispensable even than in ordinary cases If\nselection consisted merely in separating some very distinct variety and\nbreeding from it the principle would be so obvious as hardly to be worth\nnotice but its importance consists in the great effect produced by the\naccumulation in one direction during successive generations of\ndifferences absolutely inappreciable by an uneducated eyedifferences\nwhich I for one have vainly attempted to appreciate Not one man in a\nthousand has accuracy of eye and judgment sufficient to become an eminent\nbreeder If gifted with these qualities and he studies his subject for\nyears and devotes his lifetime to it with indomitable perseverance he\nwill succeed and may make great improvements if he wants any of these\nqualities he will assuredly fail Few would readily believe in the natural\ncapacity and years of practice requisite to become even a skilful\npigeonfancier\n\nThe same principles are followed by horticulturists but the variations are\nhere often more abrupt No one supposes that our choicest productions have\nbeen produced by a single variation from the aboriginal stock We have\nproofs that this is not so in some cases in which exact records have been\nkept thus to give a very trifling instance the steadilyincreasing size\nof the common gooseberry may be quoted We see an astonishing improvement\nin many florists flowers when the flowers of the present day are compared\nwith drawings made only twenty or thirty years ago When a race of plants\nis once pretty well established the seedraisers do not pick out the best\nplants but merely go over their seedbeds and pull up the rogues as\nthey call the plants that deviate from the proper standard With animals\nthis 33 kind of selection is in fact also followed for hardly any one\nis so careless as to allow his worst animals to breed\n\nIn regard to plants there is another means of observing the accumulated\neffects of selectionnamely by comparing the diversity of flowers in the\ndifferent varieties of the same species in the flowergarden the diversity\nof leaves pods or tubers or whatever part is valued in the\nkitchengarden in comparison with the flowers of the same varieties and\nthe diversity of fruit of the same species in the orchard in comparison\nwith the leaves and flowers of the same set of varieties See how different\nthe leaves of the cabbage are and how extremely alike the flowers how\nunlike the flowers of the heartsease are and how alike the leaves how\nmuch the fruit of the different kinds of gooseberries differ in size\ncolour shape and hairiness and yet the flowers present very slight\ndifferences It is not that the varieties which differ largely in some one\npoint do not differ at all in other points this is hardly ever perhaps\nnever the case The laws of correlation of growth the importance of which\nshould never be overlooked will ensure some differences but as a general\nrule I cannot doubt that the continued selection of slight variations\neither in the leaves the flowers or the fruit will produce races\ndiffering from each other chiefly in these characters\n\nIt may be objected that the principle of selection has been reduced to\nmethodical practice for scarcely more than threequarters of a century it\nhas certainly been more attended to of late years and many treatises have\nbeen published on the subject and the result has been in a corresponding\ndegree rapid and important But it is very far from true that the\nprinciple is a modern discovery I could give several references to the\nfull acknowledgment of the importance of the principle in works of high\nantiquity In rude and barbarous periods 34 of English history choice\nanimals were often imported and laws were passed to prevent their\nexportation: the destruction of horses under a certain size was ordered\nand this may be compared to the roguing of plants by nurserymen The\nprinciple of selection I find distinctly given in an ancient Chinese\nencyclopdia Explicit rules are laid down by some of the Roman classical\nwriters From passages in Genesis it is clear that the colour of domestic\nanimals was at that early period attended to Savages now sometimes cross\ntheir dogs with wild canine animals to improve the breed and they\nformerly did so as is attested by passages in Pliny The savages in South\nAfrica match their draught cattle by colour as do some of the Esquimaux\ntheir teams of dogs Livingstone shows how much good domestic breeds are\nvalued by the negroes of the interior of Africa who have not associated\nwith Europeans Some of these facts do not show actual selection but they\nshow that the breeding of domestic animals was carefully attended to in\nancient times and is now attended to by the lowest savages It would\nindeed have been a strange fact had attention not been paid to breeding\nfor the inheritance of good and bad qualities is so obvious\n\nAt the present time eminent breeders try by methodical selection with a\ndistinct object in view to make a new strain or subbreed superior to\nanything existing in the country But for our purpose a kind of\nSelection which may be called Unconscious and which results from every\none trying to possess and breed from the best individual animals is more\nimportant Thus a man who intends keeping pointers naturally tries to get\nas good dogs as he can and afterwards breeds from his own best dogs but\nhe has no wish or expectation of permanently altering the breed\nNevertheless I cannot doubt that this process continued during centuries\n35 would improve and modify any breed in the same way as Bakewell\nCollins c by this very same process only carried on more methodically\ndid greatly modify even during their own lifetimes the forms and\nqualities of their cattle Slow and insensible changes of this kind could\nnever be recognised unless actual measurements or careful drawings of the\nbreeds in question had been made long ago which might serve for\ncomparison In some cases however unchanged or but little changed\nindividuals of the same breed may be found in less civilised districts\nwhere the breed has been less improved There is reason to believe that\nKing Charless spaniel has been unconsciously modified to a large extent\nsince the time of that monarch Some highly competent authorities are\nconvinced that the setter is directly derived from the spaniel and has\nprobably been slowly altered from it It is known that the English pointer\nhas been greatly changed within the last century and in this case the\nchange has it is believed been chiefly effected by crosses with the\nfoxhound but what concerns us is that the change has been effected\nunconsciously and gradually and yet so effectually that though the old\nSpanish pointer certainly came from Spain Mr Borrow has not seen as I am\ninformed by him any native dog in Spain like our pointer\n\nBy a similar process of selection and by careful training the whole body\nof English racehorses have come to surpass in fleetness and size the parent\nArab stock so that the latter by the regulations for the Goodwood Races\nare favoured in the weights they carry Lord Spencer and others have shown\nhow the cattle of England have increased in weight and in early maturity\ncompared with the stock formerly kept in this country By comparing the\naccounts given in old pigeon treatises of carriers and tumblers with these\nbreeds as now existing in Britain 36 India and Persia we can I think\nclearly trace the stages through which they have insensibly passed and\ncome to differ so greatly from the rockpigeon\n\nYouatt gives an excellent illustration of the effects of a course of\nselection which may be considered as unconsciously followed in so far\nthat the breeders could never have expected or even have wished to have\nproduced the result which ensuednamely the production of two distinct\nstrains The two flocks of Leicester sheep kept by Mr Buckley and Mr\nBurgess as Mr Youatt remarks have been purely bred from the original\nstock of Mr Bakewell for upwards of fifty years There is not a suspicion\nexisting in the mind of any one at all acquainted with the subject that the\nowner of either of them has deviated in any one instance from the pure\nblood of Mr Bakewells flock and yet the difference between the sheep\npossessed by these two gentlemen is so great that they have the appearance\nof being quite different varieties\n\nIf there exist savages so barbarous as never to think of the inherited\ncharacter of the offspring of their domestic animals yet any one animal\nparticularly useful to them for any special purpose would be carefully\npreserved during famines and other accidents to which savages are so\nliable and such choice animals would thus generally leave more offspring\nthan the inferior ones so that in this case there would be a kind of\nunconscious selection going on We see the value set on animals even by the\nbarbarians of Tierra del Fuego by their killing and devouring their old\nwomen in times of dearth as of less value than their dogs\n\nIn plants the same gradual process of improvement through the occasional\npreservation of the best individuals whether or not sufficiently distinct\nto be ranked at their first appearance as distinct varieties and whether\n37 or not two or more species or races have become blended together by\ncrossing may plainly be recognised in the increased size and beauty which\nwe now see in the varieties of the heartsease rose pelargonium dahlia\nand other plants when compared with the older varieties or with their\nparentstocks No one would ever expect to get a firstrate heartsease or\ndahlia from the seed of a wild plant No one would expect to raise a\nfirstrate melting pear from the seed of the wild pear though he might\nsucceed from a poor seedling growing wild if it had come from a\ngardenstock The pear though cultivated in classical times appears from\nPlinys description to have been a fruit of very inferior quality I have\nseen great surprise expressed in horticultural works at the wonderful skill\nof gardeners in having produced such splendid results from such poor\nmaterials but the art I cannot doubt has been simple and as far as the\nfinal result is concerned has been followed almost unconsciously It has\nconsisted in always cultivating the best known variety sowing its seeds\nand when a slightly better variety has chanced to appear selecting it\nand so onwards But the gardeners of the classical period who cultivated\nthe best pear they could procure never thought what splendid fruit we\nshould eat though we owe our excellent fruit in some small degree to\ntheir having naturally chosen and preserved the best varieties they could\nanywhere find\n\nA large amount of change in our cultivated plants thus slowly and\nunconsciously accumulated explains as I believe the wellknown fact\nthat in a vast number of cases we cannot recognise and therefore do not\nknow the wild parentstocks of the plants which have been longest\ncultivated in our flower and kitchen gardens If it has taken centuries or\nthousands of years to improve or modify most of our plants up to their\npresent 38 standard of usefulness to man we can understand how it is\nthat neither Australia the Cape of Good Hope nor any other region\ninhabited by quite uncivilised man has afforded us a single plant worth\nculture It is not that these countries so rich in species do not by a\nstrange chance possess the aboriginal stocks of any useful plants but that\nthe native plants have not been improved by continued selection up to a\nstandard of perfection comparable with that given to the plants in\ncountries anciently civilised\n\nIn regard to the domestic animals kept by uncivilised man it should not be\noverlooked that they almost always have to struggle for their own food at\nleast during certain seasons And in two countries very differently\ncircumstanced individuals of the same species having slightly different\nconstitutions or structure would often succeed better in the one country\nthan in the other and thus by a process of natural selection as will\nhereafter be more fully explained two subbreeds might be formed This\nperhaps partly explains what has been remarked by some authors namely\nthat the varieties kept by savages have more of the character of species\nthan the varieties kept in civilised countries\n\nOn the view here given of the allimportant part which selection by man has\nplayed it becomes at once obvious how it is that our domestic races show\nadaptation in their structure or in their habits to mans wants or fancies\nWe can I think further understand the frequently abnormal character of\nour domestic races and likewise their differences being so great in\nexternal characters and relatively so slight in internal parts or organs\nMan can hardly select or only with much difficulty any deviation of\nstructure excepting such as is externally visible and indeed he rarely\ncares for what is internal He can never act by selection excepting on\nvariations 39 which are first given to him in some slight degree by\nnature No man would ever try to make a fantail till he saw a pigeon with\na tail developed in some slight degree in an unusual manner or a pouter\ntill he saw a pigeon with a crop of somewhat unusual size and the more\nabnormal or unusual any character was when it first appeared the more\nlikely it would be to catch his attention But to use such an expression as\ntrying to make a fantail is I have no doubt in most cases utterly\nincorrect The man who first selected a pigeon with a slightly larger tail\nnever dreamed what the descendants of that pigeon would become through\nlongcontinued partly unconscious and partly methodical selection Perhaps\nthe parent bird of all fantails had only fourteen tailfeathers somewhat\nexpanded like the present Java fantail or like individuals of other and\ndistinct breeds in which as many as seventeen tailfeathers have been\ncounted Perhaps the first pouterpigeon did not inflate its crop much more\nthan the turbit now does the upper part of its oesophagusa habit which\nis disregarded by all fanciers as it is not one of the points of the\nbreed\n\nNor let it be thought that some great deviation of structure would be\nnecessary to catch the fanciers eye: he perceives extremely small\ndifferences and it is in human nature to value any novelty however\nslight in ones own possession Nor must the value which would formerly be\nset on any slight differences in the individuals of the same species be\njudged of by the value which would now be set on them after several breeds\nhave once fairly been established Many slight differences might and\nindeed do now arise amongst pigeons which are rejected as faults or\ndeviations from the standard of perfection of each breed The common goose\nhas not given rise to any marked varieties hence the Thoulouse and the\ncommon breed which differ only in colour that 40 most fleeting of\ncharacters have lately been exhibited as distinct at our poultryshows\n\nI think these views further explain what has sometimes been\nnoticednamely that we know nothing about the origin or history of any of\nour domestic breeds But in fact a breed like a dialect of a language\ncan hardly be said to have had a definite origin A man preserves and\nbreeds from an individual with some slight deviation of structure or takes\nmore care than usual in matching his best animals and thus improves them\nand the improved individuals slowly spread in the immediate neighbourhood\nBut as yet they will hardly have a distinct name and from being only\nslightly valued their history will be disregarded When further improved\nby the same slow and gradual process they will spread more widely and\nwill get recognised as something distinct and valuable and will then\nprobably first receive a provincial name In semicivilised countries with\nlittle free communication the spreading and knowledge of any new subbreed\nwill be a slow process As soon as the points of value of the new subbreed\nare once fully acknowledged the principle as I have called it of\nunconscious selection will always tendperhaps more at one period than at\nanother as the breed rises or falls in fashionperhaps more in one\ndistrict than in another according to the state of civilization of the\ninhabitantsslowly to add to the characteristic features of the breed\nwhatever they may be But the chance will be infinitely small of any record\nhaving been preserved of such slow varying and insensible changes\n\nI must now say a few words on the circumstances favourable or the\nreverse to mans power of selection A high degree of variability is\nobviously favourable as freely giving the materials for selection to work\non not that mere individual differences are not amply 41 sufficient\nwith extreme care to allow of the accumulation of a large amount of\nmodification in almost any desired direction But as variations manifestly\nuseful or pleasing to man appear only occasionally the chance of their\nappearance will be much increased by a large number of individuals being\nkept and hence this comes to be of the highest importance to success On\nthis principle Marshall has remarked with respect to the sheep of parts of\nYorkshire that as they generally belong to poor people and are mostly\nin small lots they never can be improved On the other hand\nnurserymen from raising large stocks of the same plants are generally far\nmore successful than amateurs in getting new and valuable varieties The\nkeeping of a large number of individuals of a species in any country\nrequires that the species should be placed under favourable conditions of\nlife so as to breed freely in that country When the individuals of any\nspecies are scanty all the individuals whatever their quality may be\nwill generally be allowed to breed and this will effectually prevent\nselection But probably the most important point of all is that the\nanimal or plant should be so highly useful to man or so much valued by\nhim that the closest attention should be paid to even the slightest\ndeviation in the qualities or structure of each individual Unless such\nattention be paid nothing can be effected I have seen it gravely remarked\nthat it was most fortunate that the strawberry began to vary just when\ngardeners began to attend closely to this plant No doubt the strawberry\nhad always varied since it was cultivated but the slight varieties had\nbeen neglected As soon however as gardeners picked out individual plants\nwith slightly larger earlier or better fruit and raised seedlings from\nthem and again picked out the best seedlings and bred from them then\nthere appeared aided by some 42 crossing with distinct species those\nmany admirable varieties of the strawberry which have been raised during\nthe last thirty or forty years\n\nIn the case of animals with separate sexes facility in preventing crosses\nis an important element of success in the formation of new racesat\nleast in a country which is already stocked with other races In this\nrespect enclosure of the land plays a part Wandering savages or the\ninhabitants of open plains rarely possess more than one breed of the same\nspecies Pigeons can be mated for life and this is a great convenience to\nthe fancier for thus many races may be kept true though mingled in the\nsame aviary and this circumstance must have largely favoured the\nimprovement and formation of new breeds Pigeons I may add can be\npropagated in great numbers and at a very quick rate and inferior birds\nmay be freely rejected as when killed they serve for food On the other\nhand cats from their nocturnal rambling habits cannot be matched and\nalthough so much valued by women and children we hardly ever see a\ndistinct breed kept up such breeds as we do sometimes see are almost\nalways imported from some other country often from islands Although I do\nnot doubt that some domestic animals vary less than others yet the rarity\nor absence of distinct breeds of the cat the donkey peacock goose c\nmay be attributed in main part to selection not having been brought into\nplay: in cats from the difficulty in pairing them in donkeys from only a\nfew being kept by poor people and little attention paid to their breeding\nin peacocks from not being very easily reared and a large stock not kept\nin geese from being valuable only for two purposes food and feathers and\nmore especially from no pleasure having been felt in the display of\ndistinct breeds\n\nTo sum up on the origin of our Domestic Races of 43 animals and plants I\nbelieve that the conditions of life from their action on the reproductive\nsystem are so far of the highest importance as causing variability I do\nnot believe that variability is an inherent and necessary contingency\nunder all circumstances with all organic beings as some authors have\nthought The effects of variability are modified by various degrees of\ninheritance and of reversion Variability is governed by many unknown laws\nmore especially by that of correlation of growth Something may be\nattributed to the direct action of the conditions of life Something must\nbe attributed to use and disuse The final result is thus rendered\ninfinitely complex In some cases I do not doubt that the intercrossing of\nspecies aboriginally distinct has played an important part in the origin\nof our domestic productions When in any country several domestic breeds\nhave once been established their occasional intercrossing with the aid of\nselection has no doubt largely aided in the formation of new subbreeds\nbut the importance of the crossing of varieties has I believe been\ngreatly exaggerated both in regard to animals and to those plants which\nare propagated by seed In plants which are temporarily propagated by\ncuttings buds c the importance of the crossing both of distinct\nspecies and of varieties is immense for the cultivator here quite\ndisregards the extreme variability both of hybrids and mongrels and the\nfrequent sterility of hybrids but the cases of plants not propagated by\nseed are of little importance to us for their endurance is only temporary\nOver all these causes of Change I am convinced that the accumulative action\nof Selection whether applied methodically and more quickly or\nunconsciously and more slowly but more efficiently is by far the\npredominant Power\n\n                                   \n\n\n44\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nVARIATION UNDER NATURE\n\n    VariabilityIndividual differencesDoubtful speciesWide ranging\n    much diffused and common species vary mostSpecies of the larger\n    genera in any country vary more than the species of the smaller\n    generaMany of the species of the larger genera resemble varieties in\n    being very closely but unequally related to each other and in having\n    restricted ranges\n\nBefore applying the principles arrived at in the last chapter to organic\nbeings in a state of nature we must briefly discuss whether these latter\nare subject to any variation To treat this subject at all properly a long\ncatalogue of dry facts should be given but these I shall reserve for my\nfuture work Nor shall I here discuss the various definitions which have\nbeen given of the term species No one definition has as yet satisfied all\nnaturalists yet every naturalist knows vaguely what he means when he\nspeaks of a species Generally the term includes the unknown element of a\ndistinct act of creation The term variety is almost equally difficult to\ndefine but here community of descent is almost universally implied though\nit can rarely be proved We have also what are called monstrosities but\nthey graduate into varieties By a monstrosity I presume is meant some\nconsiderable deviation of structure in one part either injurious to or not\nuseful to the species and not generally propagated Some authors use the\nterm variation in a technical sense as implying a modification directly\ndue to the physical conditions of life and variations in this sense are\nsupposed not to be inherited: but who can say that the dwarfed condition of\nshells in the brackish waters of the Baltic or dwarfed 45 plants on\nAlpine summits or the thicker fur of an animal from far northwards would\nnot in some cases be inherited for at least some few generations and in\nthis case I presume that the form would be called a variety\n\nAgain we have many slight differences which may be called individual\ndifferences such as are known frequently to appear in the offspring from\nthe same parents or which may be presumed to have thus arisen from being\nfrequently observed in the individuals of the same species inhabiting the\nsame confined locality No one supposes that all the individuals of the\nsame species are cast in the very same mould These individual differences\nare highly important for us as they afford materials for natural selection\nto accumulate in the same manner as man can accumulate in any given\ndirection individual differences in his domesticated productions These\nindividual differences generally affect what naturalists consider\nunimportant parts but I could show by a long catalogue of facts that\nparts which must be called important whether viewed under a physiological\nor classificatory point of view sometimes vary in the individuals of the\nsame species I am convinced that the most experienced naturalist would be\nsurprised at the number of the cases of variability even in important\nparts of structure which he could collect on good authority as I have\ncollected during a course of years It should be remembered that\nsystematists are far from pleased at finding variability in important\ncharacters and that there are not many men who will laboriously examine\ninternal and important organs and compare them in many specimens of the\nsame species I should never have expected that the branching of the main\nnerves close to the great central ganglion of an insect would have been\nvariable in the same species I should have expected that changes of this\nnature could have been effected only 46 by slow degrees: yet quite\nrecently Mr Lubbock has shown a degree of variability in these main nerves\nin Coccus which may almost be compared to the irregular branching of the\nstem of a tree This philosophical naturalist I may add has also quite\nrecently shown that the muscles in the larv of certain insects are very\nfar from uniform Authors sometimes argue in a circle when they state that\nimportant organs never vary for these same authors practically rank that\ncharacter as important as some few naturalists have honestly confessed\nwhich does not vary and under this point of view no instance of an\nimportant part varying will ever be found: but under any other point of\nview many instances assuredly can be given\n\nThere is one point connected with individual differences which seems to me\nextremely perplexing: I refer to those genera which have sometimes been\ncalled protean or polymorphic in which the species present an\ninordinate amount of variation and hardly two naturalists can agree which\nforms to rank as species and which as varieties We may instance Rubus\nRosa and Hieracium amongst plants several genera of insects and several\ngenera of Brachiopod shells In most polymorphic genera some of the species\nhave fixed and definite characters Genera which are polymorphic in one\ncountry seem to be with some few exceptions polymorphic in other\ncountries and likewise judging from Brachiopod shells at former periods\nof time These facts seem to be very perplexing for they seem to show that\nthis kind of variability is independent of the conditions of life I am\ninclined to suspect that we see in these polymorphic genera variations in\npoints of structure which are of no service or disservice to the species\nand which consequently have not been seized on and rendered definite by\nnatural selection as hereafter will be explained 47\n\nThose forms which possess in some considerable degree the character of\nspecies but which are so closely similar to some other forms or are so\nclosely linked to them by intermediate gradations that naturalists do not\nlike to rank them as distinct species are in several respects the most\nimportant for us We have every reason to believe that many of these\ndoubtful and closelyallied forms have permanently retained their\ncharacters in their own country for a long time for as long as far as we\nknow as have good and true species Practically when a naturalist can\nunite two forms together by others having intermediate characters he\ntreats the one as a variety of the other ranking the most common but\nsometimes the one first described as the species and the other as the\nvariety But cases of great difficulty which I will not here enumerate\nsometimes occur in deciding whether or not to rank one form as a variety of\nanother even when they are closely connected by intermediate links nor\nwill the commonlyassumed hybrid nature of the intermediate links always\nremove the difficulty In very many cases however one form is ranked as a\nvariety of another not because the intermediate links have actually been\nfound but because analogy leads the observer to suppose either that they\ndo now somewhere exist or may formerly have existed and here a wide door\nfor the entry of doubt and conjecture is opened\n\nHence in determining whether a form should be ranked as a species or a\nvariety the opinion of naturalists having sound judgment and wide\nexperience seems the only guide to follow We must however in many cases\ndecide by a majority of naturalists for few wellmarked and wellknown\nvarieties can be named which have not been ranked as species by at least\nsome competent judges 48\n\nThat varieties of this doubtful nature are far from uncommon cannot be\ndisputed Compare the several floras of Great Britain of France or of the\nUnited States drawn up by different botanists and see what a surprising\nnumber of forms have been ranked by one botanist as good species and by\nanother as mere varieties Mr H C Watson to whom I lie under deep\nobligation for assistance of all kinds has marked for me 182 British\nplants which are generally considered as varieties but which have all\nbeen ranked by botanists as species and in making this list he has omitted\nmany trifling varieties but which nevertheless have been ranked by some\nbotanists as species and he has entirely omitted several highly\npolymorphic genera Under genera including the most polymorphic forms Mr\nBabington gives 251 species whereas Mr Bentham gives only 112a\ndifference of 139 doubtful forms Amongst animals which unite for each\nbirth and which are highly locomotive doubtful forms ranked by one\nzoologist as a species and by another as a variety can rarely be found\nwithin the same country but are common in separated areas How many of\nthose birds and insects in North America and Europe which differ very\nslightly from each other have been ranked by one eminent naturalist as\nundoubted species and by another as varieties or as they are often\ncalled as geographical races Many years ago when comparing and seeing\nothers compare the birds from the separate islands of the Galapagos\nArchipelago both one with another and with those from the American\nmainland I was much struck how entirely vague and arbitrary is the\ndistinction between species and varieties On the islets of the little\nMadeira group there are many insects which are characterized as varieties\nin Mr Wollastons admirable work but which it cannot 49 be doubted\nwould be ranked as distinct species by many entomologists Even Ireland has\na few animals now generally regarded as varieties but which have been\nranked as species by some zoologists Several most experienced\nornithologists consider our British red grouse as only a stronglymarked\nrace of a Norwegian species whereas the greater number rank it as an\nundoubted species peculiar to Great Britain A wide distance between the\nhomes of two doubtful forms leads many naturalists to rank both as distinct\nspecies but what distance it has been well asked will suffice if that\nbetween America and Europe is ample will that between the Continent and\nthe Azores or Madeira or the Canaries or Ireland be sufficient It must\nbe admitted that many forms considered by highlycompetent judges as\nvarieties have so perfectly the character of species that they are ranked\nby other highlycompetent judges as good and true species But to discuss\nwhether they are rightly called species or varieties before any definition\nof these terms has been generally accepted is vainly to beat the air\n\nMany of the cases of stronglymarked varieties or doubtful species well\ndeserve consideration for several interesting lines of argument from\ngeographical distribution analogical variation hybridism c have been\nbrought to bear on the attempt to determine their rank I will here give\nonly a single instancethe wellknown one of the primrose and cowslip or\nPrimula vulgaris and veris These plants differ considerably in appearance\nthey have a different flavour and emit a different odour they flower at\nslightly different periods they grow in somewhat different stations they\nascend mountains to different heights they have different geographical\nranges and lastly according to very numerous experiments made during\nseveral years by 50 that most careful observer Grtner they can be\ncrossed only with much difficulty We could hardly wish for better evidence\nof the two forms being specifically distinct On the other hand they are\nunited by many intermediate links and it is very doubtful whether these\nlinks are hybrids and there is as it seems to me an overwhelming amount\nof experimental evidence showing that they descend from common parents\nand consequently must be ranked as varieties\n\nClose investigation in most cases will bring naturalists to an agreement\nhow to rank doubtful forms Yet it must be confessed that it is in the\nbestknown countries that we find the greatest number of forms of doubtful\nvalue I have been struck with the fact that if any animal or plant in a\nstate of nature be highly useful to man or from any cause closely attract\nhis attention varieties of it will almost universally be found recorded\nThese varieties moreover will be often ranked by some authors as species\nLook at the common oak how closely it has been studied yet a German\nauthor makes more than a dozen species out of forms which are very\ngenerally considered as varieties and in this country the highest\nbotanical authorities and practical men can be quoted to show that the\nsessile and pedunculated oaks are either good and distinct species or mere\nvarieties\n\nWhen a young naturalist commences the study of a group of organisms quite\nunknown to him he is at first much perplexed to determine what differences\nto consider as specific and what as varieties for he knows nothing of the\namount and kind of variation to which the group is subject and this shows\nat least how very generally there is some variation But if he confine his\nattention to one class within one country he will soon make up his mind\nhow to rank most of the doubtful forms His 51 general tendency will be\nto make many species for he will become impressed just like the pigeon or\npoultry fancier before alluded to with the amount of difference in the\nforms which he is continually studying and he has little general knowledge\nof analogical variation in other groups and in other countries by which to\ncorrect his first impressions As he extends the range of his observations\nhe will meet with more cases of difficulty for he will encounter a greater\nnumber of closelyallied forms But if his observations be widely extended\nhe will in the end generally be enabled to make up his own mind which to\ncall varieties and which species but he will succeed in this at the\nexpense of admitting much variationand the truth of this admission will\noften be disputed by other naturalists When moreover he comes to study\nallied forms brought from countries not now continuous in which case he\ncan hardly hope to find the intermediate links between his doubtful forms\nhe will have to trust almost entirely to analogy and his difficulties rise\nto a climax\n\nCertainly no clear line of demarcation has as yet been drawn between\nspecies and subspeciesthat is the forms which in the opinion of some\nnaturalists come very near to but do not quite arrive at the rank of\nspecies or again between subspecies and wellmarked varieties or\nbetween lesser varieties and individual differences These differences\nblend into each other in an insensible series and a series impresses the\nmind with the idea of an actual passage\n\nHence I look at individual differences though of small interest to the\nsystematist as of high importance for us as being the first step towards\nsuch slight varieties as are barely thought worth recording in works on\nnatural history And I look at varieties which are in any degree more\ndistinct and permanent as steps leading to more 52 strongly marked and\nmore permanent varieties and at these latter as leading to subspecies\nand to species The passage from one stage of difference to another and\nhigher stage may be in some cases due merely to the longcontinued action\nof different physical conditions in two different regions but I have not\nmuch faith in this view and I attribute the passage of a variety from a\nstate in which it differs very slightly from its parent to one in which it\ndiffers more to the action of natural selection in accumulating as will\nhereafter be more fully explained differences of structure in certain\ndefinite directions Hence I believe a wellmarked variety may be called an\nincipient species but whether this belief be justifiable must be judged of\nby the general weight of the several facts and views given throughout this\nwork\n\nIt need not be supposed that all varieties or incipient species necessarily\nattain the rank of species They may whilst in this incipient state become\nextinct or they may endure as varieties for very long periods as has been\nshown to be the case by Mr Wollaston with the varieties of certain fossil\nlandshells in Madeira If a variety were to flourish so as to exceed in\nnumbers the parent species it would then rank as the species and the\nspecies as the variety or it might come to supplant and exterminate the\nparent species or both might coexist and both rank as independent\nspecies But we shall hereafter have to return to this subject\n\nFrom these remarks it will be seen that I look at the term species as one\narbitrarily given for the sake of convenience to a set of individuals\nclosely resembling each other and that it does not essentially differ from\nthe term variety which is given to less distinct and more fluctuating\nforms The term variety again in comparison with mere individual\ndifferences is also applied arbitrarily and for mere convenience sake\n53\n\nGuided by theoretical considerations I thought that some interesting\nresults might be obtained in regard to the nature and relations of the\nspecies which vary most by tabulating all the varieties in several\nwellworked floras At first this seemed a simple task but Mr H C\nWatson to whom I am much indebted for valuable advice and assistance on\nthis subject soon convinced me that there were many difficulties as did\nsubsequently Dr Hooker even in stronger terms I shall reserve for my\nfuture work the discussion of these difficulties and the tables themselves\nof the proportional numbers of the varying species Dr Hooker permits me\nto add that after having carefully read my manuscript and examined the\ntables he thinks that the following statements are fairly well\nestablished The whole subject however treated as it necessarily here is\nwith much brevity is rather perplexing and allusions cannot be avoided to\nthe struggle for existence divergence of character and other\nquestions hereafter to be discussed\n\nAlph de Candolle and others have shown that plants which have very wide\nranges generally present varieties and this might have been expected as\nthey become exposed to diverse physical conditions and as they come into\ncompetition which as we shall hereafter see is a far more important\ncircumstance with different sets of organic beings But my tables further\nshow that in any limited country the species which are most common that\nis abound most in individuals and the species which are most widely\ndiffused within their own country and this is a different consideration\nfrom wide range and to a certain extent from commonness often give rise\nto varieties sufficiently wellmarked to have been recorded in botanical\nworks Hence it is the most flourishing or as they may be called the\ndominant speciesthose 54 which range widely over the world are the\nmost diffused in their own country and are the most numerous in\nindividualswhich oftenest produce wellmarked varieties or as I\nconsider them incipient species And this perhaps might have been\nanticipated for as varieties in order to become in any degree permanent\nnecessarily have to struggle with the other inhabitants of the country the\nspecies which are already dominant will be the most likely to yield\noffspring which though in some slight degree modified still inherit\nthose advantages that enabled their parents to become dominant over their\ncompatriots\n\nIf the plants inhabiting a country and described in any Flora be divided\ninto two equal masses all those in the larger genera being placed on one\nside and all those in the smaller genera on the other side a somewhat\nlarger number of the very common and much diffused or dominant species will\nbe found on the side of the larger genera This again might have been\nanticipated for the mere fact of many species of the same genus inhabiting\nany country shows that there is something in the organic or inorganic\nconditions of that country favourable to the genus and consequently we\nmight have expected to have found in the larger genera or those including\nmany species a large proportional number of dominant species But so many\ncauses tend to obscure this result that I am surprised that my tables show\neven a small majority on the side of the larger genera I will here allude\nto only two causes of obscurity Freshwater and saltloving plants have\ngenerally very wide ranges and are much diffused but this seems to be\nconnected with the nature of the stations inhabited by them and has little\nor no relation to the size of the genera to which the species belong\nAgain plants low in the scale of organisation are 55 generally much more\nwidely diffused than plants higher in the scale and here again there is no\nclose relation to the size of the genera The cause of lowlyorganised\nplants ranging widely will be discussed in our chapter on geographical\ndistribution\n\nFrom looking at species as only stronglymarked and welldefined varieties\nI was led to anticipate that the species of the larger genera in each\ncountry would oftener present varieties than the species of the smaller\ngenera for wherever many closely related species ie species of the\nsame genus have been formed many varieties or incipient species ought as\na general rule to be now forming Where many large trees grow we expect\nto find saplings Where many species of a genus have been formed through\nvariation circumstances have been favourable for variation and hence we\nmight expect that the circumstances would generally be still favourable to\nvariation On the other hand if we look at each species as a special act\nof creation there is no apparent reason why more varieties should occur in\na group having many species than in one having few\n\nTo test the truth of this anticipation I have arranged the plants of twelve\ncountries and the coleopterous insects of two districts into two nearly\nequal masses the species of the larger genera on one side and those of\nthe smaller genera on the other side and it has invariably proved to be\nthe case that a larger proportion of the species on the side of the larger\ngenera present varieties than on the side of the smaller genera Moreover\nthe species of the large genera which present any varieties invariably\npresent a larger average number of varieties than do the species of the\nsmall genera Both these results follow when another division is made and\nwhen all the smallest genera with from only one to four species are\nabsolutely excluded from the tables These 56 facts are of plain\nsignification on the view that species are only strongly marked and\npermanent varieties for wherever many species of the same genus have been\nformed or where if we may use the expression the manufactory of species\nhas been active we ought generally to find the manufactory still in\naction more especially as we have every reason to believe the process of\nmanufacturing new species to be a slow one And this certainly is the case\nif varieties be looked at as incipient species for my tables clearly show\nas a general rule that wherever many species of a genus have been formed\nthe species of that genus present a number of varieties that is of\nincipient species beyond the average It is not that all large genera are\nnow varying much and are thus increasing in the number of their species\nor that no small genera are now varying and increasing for if this had\nbeen so it would have been fatal to my theory inasmuch as geology plainly\ntells us that small genera have in the lapse of time often increased\ngreatly in size and that large genera have often come to their maxima\ndeclined and disappeared All that we want to show is that where many\nspecies of a genus have been formed on an average many are still forming\nand this holds good\n\nThere are other relations between the species of large genera and their\nrecorded varieties which deserve notice We have seen that there is no\ninfallible criterion by which to distinguish species and wellmarked\nvarieties and in those cases in which intermediate links have not been\nfound between doubtful forms naturalists are compelled to come to a\ndetermination by the amount of difference between them judging by analogy\nwhether or not the amount suffices to raise one or both to the rank of\nspecies Hence the amount of difference is one very important criterion in\nsettling whether two forms 57 should be ranked as species or varieties\nNow Fries has remarked in regard to plants and Westwood in regard to\ninsects that in large genera the amount of difference between the species\nis often exceedingly small I have endeavoured to test this numerically by\naverages and as far as my imperfect results go they confirm the view I\nhave also consulted some sagacious and experienced observers and after\ndeliberation they concur in this view In this respect therefore the\nspecies of the larger genera resemble varieties more than do the species\nof the smaller genera Or the case may be put in another way and it may be\nsaid that in the larger genera in which a number of varieties or\nincipient species greater than the average are now manufacturing many of\nthe species already manufactured still to a certain extent resemble\nvarieties for they differ from each other by a less than usual amount of\ndifference\n\nMoreover the species of the large genera are related to each other in the\nsame manner as the varieties of any one species are related to each other\nNo naturalist pretends that all the species of a genus are equally distinct\nfrom each other they may generally be divided into subgenera or\nsections or lesser groups As Fries has well remarked little groups of\nspecies are generally clustered like satellites around certain other\nspecies And what are varieties but groups of forms unequally related to\neach other and clustered round certain formsthat is round their\nparentspecies Undoubtedly there is one most important point of difference\nbetween varieties and species namely that the amount of difference\nbetween varieties when compared with each other or with their\nparentspecies is much less than that between the species of the same\ngenus But when we come to discuss the principle as I call it of\nDivergence of Character 58 we shall see how this may be explained and\nhow the lesser differences between varieties will tend to increase into the\ngreater differences between species\n\nThere is one other point which seems to me worth notice Varieties\ngenerally have much restricted ranges: this statement is indeed scarcely\nmore than a truism for if a variety were found to have a wider range than\nthat of its supposed parentspecies their denominations ought to be\nreversed But there is also reason to believe that those species which are\nvery closely allied to other species and in so far resemble varieties\noften have much restricted ranges For instance Mr H C Watson has\nmarked for me in the wellsifted London Catalogue of plants 4th edition\n63 plants which are therein ranked as species but which he considers as so\nclosely allied to other species as to be of doubtful value: these 63\nreputed species range on an average over 69 of the provinces into which\nMr Watson has divided Great Britain Now in this same catalogue 53\nacknowledged varieties are recorded and these range over 77 provinces\nwhereas the species to which these varieties belong range over 143\nprovinces So that the acknowledged varieties have very nearly the same\nrestricted average range as have those very closely allied forms marked\nfor me by Mr Watson as doubtful species but which are almost universally\nranked by British botanists as good and true species\n\n\n\nFinally then varieties have the same general characters as species for\nthey cannot be distinguished from speciesexcept firstly by the\ndiscovery of intermediate linking forms and the occurrence of such links\ncannot affect the actual characters of the forms which they connect and\nexcept secondly by a certain amount of 59 difference for two forms if\ndiffering very little are generally ranked as varieties notwithstanding\nthat intermediate linking forms have not been discovered but the amount of\ndifference considered necessary to give to two forms the rank of species is\nquite indefinite In genera having more than the average number of species\nin any country the species of these genera have more than the average\nnumber of varieties In large genera the species are apt to be closely but\nunequally allied together forming little clusters round certain species\nSpecies very closely allied to other species apparently have restricted\nranges In all these several respects the species of large genera present a\nstrong analogy with varieties And we can clearly understand these\nanalogies if species have once existed as varieties and have thus\noriginated: whereas these analogies are utterly inexplicable if each\nspecies has been independently created\n\nWe have also seen that it is the most flourishing or dominant species of\nthe larger genera which on an average vary most and varieties as we shall\nhereafter see tend to become converted into new and distinct species The\nlarger genera thus tend to become larger and throughout nature the forms\nof life which are now dominant tend to become still more dominant by\nleaving many modified and dominant descendants But by steps hereafter to\nbe explained the larger genera also tend to break up into smaller genera\nAnd thus the forms of life throughout the universe become divided into\ngroups subordinate to groups\n\n                                   \n\n\n60\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nSTRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE\n\n    Bears on natural selectionThe term used in a wide senseGeometrical\n

the same\n    genusThe relation of organism to organism the most important of all\n    relations\n\nBefore entering on the subject of this chapter I must make a few\npreliminary remarks to show how the struggle for existence bears on\nNatural Selection It has been seen in the last chapter that amongst\norganic beings in a state of nature there is some individual variability:\nindeed I am not aware that this has ever been disputed It is immaterial\nfor us whether a multitude of doubtful forms be called species or\nsubspecies or varieties what rank for instance the two or three hundred\ndoubtful forms of British plants are entitled to hold if the existence of\nany wellmarked varieties be admitted But the mere existence of individual\nvariability and of some few wellmarked varieties though necessary as the\nfoundation for the work helps us but little in understanding how species\narise in nature How have all those exquisite adaptations of one part of\nthe organisation to another part and to the conditions of life and of one\ndistinct organic being to another being been perfected We see these\nbeautiful coadaptations most 61 plainly in the woodpecker and missletoe\nand only a little less plainly in the humblest parasite which clings to the\nhairs of a quadruped or feathers of a bird in the structure of the beetle\nwhich dives through the water in the plumed seed which is wafted by the\ngentlest breeze in short we see beautiful adaptations everywhere and in\nevery part of the organic world\n\nAgain it may be asked how is it that varieties which I have called\nincipient species become ultimately converted into good and distinct\nspecies which in most cases obviously differ from each other far more than\ndo the varieties of the same species How do those groups of species which\nconstitute what are called distinct genera and which differ from each\nother more than do the species of the same genus arise All these results\nas we shall more fully see in the next chapter follow from the struggle\nfor life Owing to this struggle for life any variation however slight\nand from whatever cause proceeding if it be in any degree profitable to an\nindividual of any species in its infinitely complex relations to other\norganic beings and to external nature will tend to the preservation of\nthat individual and will generally be inherited by its offspring The\noffspring also will thus have a better chance of surviving for of the\nmany individuals of any species which are periodically born but a small\nnumber can survive I have called this principle by which each slight\nvariation if useful is preserved by the term of Natural Selection in\norder to mark its relation to mans power of selection We have seen that\nman by selection can certainly produce great results and can adapt organic\nbeings to his own uses through the accumulation of slight but useful\nvariations given to him by the hand of Nature But Natural Selection as\nwe shall hereafter see is a power incessantly ready for action and is as\n62 immeasurably superior to mans feeble efforts as the works of Nature\nare to those of Art\n\nWe will now discuss in a little more detail the struggle for existence In\nmy future work this subject shall be treated as it well deserves at much\ngreater length The elder de Candolle and Lyell have largely and\nphilosophically shown that all organic beings are exposed to severe\ncompetition In regard to plants no one has treated this subject with more\nspirit and ability than W Herbert Dean of Manchester evidently the\nresult of his great horticultural knowledge Nothing is easier than to\nadmit in words the truth of the universal struggle for life or more\ndifficultat least I have found it sothan constantly to bear this\nconclusion in mind Yet unless it be thoroughly engrained in the mind I am\nconvinced that the whole economy of nature with every fact on\ndistribution rarity abundance extinction and variation will be dimly\nseen or quite misunderstood We behold the face of nature bright with\ngladness we often see superabundance of food we do not see or we forget\nthat the birds which are idly singing round us mostly live on insects or\nseeds and are thus constantly destroying life or we forget how largely\nthese songsters or their eggs or their nestlings are destroyed by birds\nand beasts of prey we do not always bear in mind that though food may be\nnow superabundant it is not so at all seasons of each recurring year\n\nI should premise that I use the term Struggle for Existence in a large and\nmetaphorical sense including dependence of one being on another and\nincluding which is more important not only the life of the individual\nbut success in leaving progeny Two canine animals in a time of dearth may\nbe truly said to struggle with each other which shall get food and live\nBut a plant on the edge of a desert is said to struggle 63 for life\nagainst the drought though more properly it should be said to be dependent\non the moisture A plant which annually produces a thousand seeds of which\non an average only one comes to maturity may be more truly said to\nstruggle with the plants of the same and other kinds which already clothe\nthe ground The missletoe is dependent on the apple and a few other trees\nbut can only in a farfetched sense be said to struggle with these trees\nfor if too many of these parasites grow on the same tree it will languish\nand die But several seedling missletoes growing close together on the\nsame branch may more truly be said to struggle with each other As the\nmissletoe is disseminated by birds its existence depends on birds and it\nmay metaphorically be said to struggle with other fruitbearing plants in\norder to tempt birds to devour and thus disseminate its seeds rather than\nthose of other plants In these several senses which pass into each other\nI use for convenience sake the general term of struggle for existence\n\nA struggle for existence inevitably follows from the high rate at which all\norganic beings tend to increase Every being which during its natural\nlifetime produces several eggs or seeds must suffer destruction during\nsome period of its life and during some season or occasional year\notherwise on the principle of geometrical increase its numbers would\nquickly become so inordinately great that no country could support the\nproduct Hence as more individuals are produced than can possibly survive\nthere must in every case be a struggle for existence either one individual\nwith another of the same species or with the individuals of distinct\nspecies or with the physical conditions of life It is the doctrine of\nMalthus applied with manifold force to the whole animal and vegetable\nkingdoms for in this case there 64 can be no artificial increase of\nfood and no prudential restraint from marriage Although some species may\nbe now increasing more or less rapidly in numbers all cannot do so for\nthe world would not hold them\n\nThere is no exception to the rule that every organic being naturally\nincreases at so high a rate that if not destroyed the earth would soon be\ncovered by the progeny of a single pair Even slowbreeding man has doubled\nin twentyfive years and at this rate in a few thousand years there\nwould literally not be standing room for his progeny Linnus has\ncalculated that if an annual plant produced only two seedsand there is no\nplant so unproductive as thisand their seedlings next year produced two\nand so on then in twenty years there would be a million plants The\nelephant is reckoned the slowest breeder of all known animals and I have\ntaken some pains to estimate its probable minimum rate of natural increase:\nit will be under the mark to assume that it breeds when thirty years old\nand goes on breeding till ninety years old bringing forth three pair of\nyoung in this interval if this be so at the end of the fifth century\nthere would be alive fifteen million elephants descended from the first\npair\n\nBut we have better evidence on this subject than mere theoretical\ncalculations namely the numerous recorded cases of the astonishingly\nrapid increase of various animals in a state of nature when circumstances\nhave been favourable to them during two or three following seasons Still\nmore striking is the evidence from our domestic animals of many kinds which\nhave run wild in several parts of the world: if the statements of the rate\nof increase of slowbreeding cattle and horses in South America and\nlatterly in Australia had not been well authenticated they would have\nbeen incredible So it is with plants: cases could be given of 65\nintroduced plants which have become common throughout whole islands in a\nperiod of less than ten years Several of the plants such as the cardoon\nand a tall thistle now most numerous over the wide plains of La Plata\nclothing square leagues of surface almost to the exclusion of all other\nplants have been introduced from Europe and there are plants which now\nrange in India as I hear from Dr Falconer from Cape Comorin to the\nHimalaya which have been imported from America since its discovery In\nsuch cases and endless instances could be given no one supposes that the\nfertility of these animals or plants has been suddenly and temporarily\nincreased in any sensible degree The obvious explanation is that the\nconditions of life have been very favourable and that there has\nconsequently been less destruction of the old and young and that nearly\nall the young have been enabled to breed In such cases the geometrical\nratio of increase the result of which never fails to be surprising simply\nexplains the extraordinarily rapid increase and wide diffusion of\nnaturalised productions in their new homes\n\nIn a state of nature almost every plant produces seed and amongst animals\nthere are very few which do not annually pair Hence we may confidently\nassert that all plants and animals are tending to increase at a\ngeometrical ratio that all would most rapidly stock every station in which\nthey could any how exist and that the geometrical tendency to increase\nmust be checked by destruction at some period of life Our familiarity with\nthe larger domestic animals tends I think to mislead us: we see no great\ndestruction falling on them and we forget that thousands are annually\nslaughtered for food and that in a state of nature an equal number would\nhave somehow to be disposed of\n\nThe only difference between organisms which annually 66 produce eggs or\nseeds by the thousand and those which produce extremely few is that the\nslowbreeders would require a few more years to people under favourable\nconditions a whole district let it be ever so large The condor lays a\ncouple of eggs and the ostrich a score and yet in the same country the\ncondor may be the more numerous of the two: the Fulmar petrel lays but one\negg yet it is believed to be the most numerous bird in the world One fly\ndeposits hundreds of eggs and another like the hippobosca a single one\nbut this difference does not determine how many individuals of the two\nspecies can be supported in a district A large number of eggs is of some\nimportance to those species which depend on a rapidly fluctuating amount of\nfood for it allows them rapidly to increase in number But the real\nimportance of a large number of eggs or seeds is to make up for much\ndestruction at some period of life and this period in the great majority\nof cases is an early one If an animal can in any way protect its own eggs\nor young a small number may be produced and yet the average stock be\nfully kept up but if many eggs or young are destroyed many must be\nproduced or the species will become extinct It would suffice to keep up\nthe full number of a tree which lived on an average for a thousand years\nif a single seed were produced once in a thousand years supposing that\nthis seed were never destroyed and could be ensured to germinate in a\nfitting place So that in all cases the average number of any animal or\nplant depends only indirectly on the number of its eggs or seeds\n\nIn looking at Nature it is most necessary to keep the foregoing\nconsiderations always in mindnever to forget that every single organic\nbeing around us may be said to be striving to the utmost to increase in\nnumbers that each lives by a struggle at some period of 67 its life\nthat heavy destruction inevitably falls either on the young or old during\neach generation or at recurrent intervals Lighten any check mitigate the\ndestruction ever so little and the number of the species will almost\ninstantaneously increase to any amount\n\nThe causes which check the natural tendency of each species to increase in\nnumber are most obscure Look at the most vigorous species by as much as\nit swarms in numbers by so much will its tendency to increase be still\nfurther increased We know not exactly what the checks are in even one\nsingle instance Nor will this surprise any one who reflects how ignorant\nwe are on this head even in regard to mankind so incomparably better\nknown than any other animal This subject has been ably treated by several\nauthors and I shall in my future work discuss some of the checks at\nconsiderable length more especially in regard to the feral animals of\nSouth America Here I will make only a few remarks just to recall to the\nreaders mind some of the chief points Eggs or very young animals seem\ngenerally to suffer most but this is not invariably the case With plants\nthere is a vast destruction of seeds but from some observations which I\nhave made I believe that it is the seedlings which suffer most from\ngerminating in ground already thickly stocked with other plants Seedlings\nalso are destroyed in vast numbers by various enemies for instance on a\npiece of ground three feet long and two wide dug and cleared and where\nthere could be no choking from other plants I marked all the seedlings of\nour native weeds as they came up and out of the 357 no less than 295 were\ndestroyed chiefly by slugs and insects If turf which has long been mown\nand the case would be the same with turf closely browsed by quadrupeds be\nlet to grow the more vigorous plants 68 gradually kill the less\nvigorous though fully grown plants: thus out of twenty species growing on\na little plot of turf three feet by four nine species perished from the\nother species being allowed to grow up freely\n\nThe amount of food for each species of course gives the extreme limit to\nwhich each can increase but very frequently it is not the obtaining food\nbut the serving as prey to other animals which determines the average\nnumbers of a species Thus there seems to be little doubt that the stock\nof partridges grouse and hares on any large estate depends chiefly on the\ndestruction of vermin If not one head of game were shot during the next\ntwenty years in England and at the same time if no vermin were\ndestroyed there would in all probability be less game than at present\nalthough hundreds of thousands of game animals are now annually killed On\nthe other hand in some cases as with the elephant and rhinoceros none\nare destroyed by beasts of prey: even the tiger in India most rarely dares\nto attack a young elephant protected by its dam\n\nClimate plays an important part in determining the average numbers of a\nspecies and periodical seasons of extreme cold or drought I believe to be\nthe most effective of all checks I estimated that the winter of 185455\ndestroyed fourfifths of the birds in my own grounds and this is a\ntremendous destruction when we remember that ten per cent is an\nextraordinarily severe mortality from epidemics with man The action of\nclimate seems at first sight to be quite independent of the struggle for\nexistence but in so far as climate chiefly acts in reducing food it\nbrings on the most severe struggle between the individuals whether of the\nsame or of distinct species which subsist on the same kind of food Even\nwhen climate for instance extreme cold 69 acts directly it will be the\nleast vigorous or those which have got least food through the advancing\nwinter which will suffer most When we travel from south to north or from\na damp region to a dry we invariably see some species gradually getting\nrarer and rarer and finally disappearing and the change of climate being\nconspicuous we are tempted to attribute the whole effect to its direct\naction But this is a false view: we forget that each species even where\nit most abounds is constantly suffering enormous destruction at some\nperiod of its life from enemies or from competitors for the same place and\nfood and if these enemies or competitors be in the least degree favoured\nby any slight change of climate they will increase in numbers and as\neach area is already fully stocked with inhabitants the other species will\ndecrease When we travel southward and see a species decreasing in numbers\nwe may feel sure that the cause lies quite as much in other species being\nfavoured as in this one being hurt So it is when we travel northward but\nin a somewhat lesser degree for the number of species of all kinds and\ntherefore of competitors decreases northwards hence in going northward\nor in ascending a mountain we far oftener meet with stunted forms due to\nthe directly injurious action of climate than we do in proceeding\nsouthwards or in descending a mountain When we reach the Arctic regions\nor snowcapped summits or absolute deserts the struggle for life is\nalmost exclusively with the elements\n\nThat climate acts in main part indirectly by favouring other species we\nmay clearly see in the prodigious number of plants in our gardens which can\nperfectly well endure our climate but which never become naturalised for\nthey cannot compete with our native plants nor resist destruction by our\nnative animals 70\n\nWhen a species owing to highly favourable circumstances increases\ninordinately in numbers in a small tract epidemicsat least this seems\ngenerally to occur with our game animalsoften ensue: and here we have a\nlimiting check independent of the struggle for life But even some of these\nsocalled epidemics appear to be due to parasitic worms which have from\nsome cause possibly in part through facility of diffusion amongst the\ncrowded animals been disproportionably favoured: and here comes in a sort\nof struggle between the parasite and its prey\n\nOn the other hand in many cases a large stock of individuals of the same\nspecies relatively to the numbers of its enemies is absolutely necessary\nfor its preservation Thus we can easily raise plenty of corn and\nrapeseed c in our fields because the seeds are in great excess\ncompared with the number of birds which feed on them nor can the birds\nthough having a superabundance of food at this one season increase in\nnumber proportionally to the supply of seed as their numbers are checked\nduring winter: but any one who has tried knows how troublesome it is to\nget seed from a few wheat or other such plants in a garden: I have in this\ncase lost every single seed This view of the necessity of a large stock of\nthe same species for its preservation explains I believe some singular\nfacts in nature such as that of very rare plants being sometimes extremely\nabundant in the few spots where they do occur and that of some social\nplants being social that is abounding in individuals even on the extreme\nconfines of their range For in such cases we may believe that a plant\ncould exist only where the conditions of its life were so favourable that\nmany could exist together and thus save the species from utter\ndestruction I should add that the good effects of frequent intercrossing\nand 71 the ill effects of close interbreeding probably come into play in\nsome of these cases but on this intricate subject I will not here enlarge\n\nMany cases are on record showing how complex and unexpected are the checks\nand relations between organic beings which have to struggle together in\nthe same country I will give only a single instance which though a\nsimple one has interested me In Staffordshire on the estate of a\nrelation where I had ample means of investigation there was a large and\nextremely barren heath which had never been touched by the hand of man\nbut several hundred acres of exactly the same nature had been enclosed\ntwentyfive years previously and planted with Scotch fir The change in the\nnative vegetation of the planted part of the heath was most remarkable\nmore than is generally seen in passing from one quite different soil to\nanother: not only the proportional numbers of the heathplants were wholly\nchanged but twelve species of plants not counting grasses and carices\nflourished in the plantations which could not be found on the heath The\neffect on the insects must have been still greater for six insectivorous\nbirds were very common in the plantations which were not to be seen on the\nheath and the heath was frequented by two or three distinct insectivorous\nbirds Here we see how potent has been the effect of the introduction of a\nsingle tree nothing whatever else having been done with the exception\nthat the land had been enclosed so that cattle could not enter But how\nimportant an element enclosure is I plainly saw near Farnham in Surrey\nHere there are extensive heaths with a few clumps of old Scotch firs on\nthe distant hilltops: within the last ten years large spaces have been\nenclosed and selfsown firs are now springing up in multitudes so close\ntogether that all cannot live 72 When I ascertained that these young\ntrees had not been sown or planted I was so much surprised at their\nnumbers that I went to several points of view whence I could examine\nhundreds of acres of the unenclosed heath and literally I could not see a\nsingle Scotch fir except the old planted clumps But on looking closely\nbetween the stems of the heath I found a multitude of seedlings and little\ntrees which had been perpetually browsed down by the cattle In one square\nyard at a point some hundred yards distant from one of the old clumps I\ncounted thirtytwo little trees and one of them with twentysix rings of\ngrowth had during many years tried to raise its head above the stems of\nthe heath and had failed No wonder that as soon as the land was\nenclosed it became thickly clothed with vigorously growing young firs Yet\nthe heath was so extremely barren and so extensive that no one would ever\nhave imagined that cattle would have so closely and effectually searched it\nfor food\n\nHere we see that cattle absolutely determine the existence of the Scotch\nfir but in several parts of the world insects determine the existence of\ncattle Perhaps Paraguay offers the most curious instance of this for here\nneither cattle nor horses nor dogs have ever run wild though they swarm\nsouthward and northward in a feral state and Azara and Rengger have shown\nthat this is caused by the greater number in Paraguay of a certain fly\nwhich lays its eggs in the navels of these animals when first born The\nincrease of these flies numerous as they are must be habitually checked\nby some means probably by birds Hence if certain insectivorous birds\nwhose numbers are probably regulated by hawks or beasts of prey were to\nincrease in Paraguay the flies would decreasethen cattle and horses\nwould became feral and this would certainly greatly 73 alter as indeed\nI have observed in parts of South America the vegetation: this again would\nlargely affect the insects and this as we just have seen in\nStaffordshire the insectivorous birds and so onwards in everincreasing\ncircles of complexity We began this series by insectivorous birds and we\nhave ended with them Not that in nature the relations can ever be as\nsimple as this Battle within battle must ever be recurring with varying\nsuccess and yet in the longrun the forces are so nicely balanced that\nthe face of nature remains uniform for long periods of time though\nassuredly the merest trifle would often give the victory to one organic\nbeing over another Nevertheless so profound is our ignorance and so high\nour presumption that we marvel when we hear of the extinction of an\norganic being and as we do not see the cause we invoke cataclysms to\ndesolate the world or invent laws on the duration of the forms of life\n\nI am tempted to give one more instance showing how plants and animals most\nremote in the scale of nature are bound together by a web of complex\nrelations I shall hereafter have occasion to show that the exotic Lobelia\nfulgens in this part of England is never visited by insects and\nconsequently from its peculiar structure never can set a seed Many of\nour orchidaceous plants absolutely require the visits of moths to remove\ntheir pollenmasses and thus to fertilise them I have also reason to\nbelieve that humblebees are indispensable to the fertilisation of the\nheartsease Viola tricolor for other bees do not visit this flower From\nexperiments which I have lately tried I have found that the visits of bees\nare necessary for the fertilisation of some kinds of clover but\nhumblebees alone visit the red clover Trifolium pratense as other bees\ncannot reach the nectar Hence I have very little doubt that if the 74\nwhole genus of humblebees became extinct or very rare in England the\nheartsease and red clover would become very rare or wholly disappear The\nnumber of humblebees in any district depends in a great degree on the\nnumber of fieldmice which destroy their combs and nests and Mr H\nNewman who has long attended to the habits of humblebees believes that\nmore than twothirds of them are thus destroyed all over England Now the\nnumber of mice is largely dependent as every one knows on the number of\ncats and Mr Newman says Near villages and small towns I have found the\nnests of humblebees more numerous than elsewhere which I attribute to the\nnumber of cats that destroy the mice Hence it is quite credible that the\npresence of a feline animal in large numbers in a district might determine\nthrough the intervention first of mice and then of bees the frequency of\ncertain flowers in that district\n\nIn the case of every species many different checks acting at different\nperiods of life and during different seasons or years probably come into\nplay some one check or some few being generally the most potent but all\nconcur in determining the average number or even the existence of the\nspecies In some cases it can be shown that widelydifferent checks act on\nthe same species in different districts When we look at the plants and\nbushes clothing an entangled bank we are tempted to attribute their\nproportional numbers and kinds to what we call chance But how false a view\nis this Every one has heard that when an American forest is cut down a\nvery different vegetation springs up but it has been observed that ancient\nIndian ruins in the Southern United States which must formerly have been\ncleared of trees now display the same beautiful diversity and proportion\nof kinds as in the surrounding 75 virgin forests What a struggle between\nthe several kinds of trees must here have gone on during long centuries\neach annually scattering its seeds by the thousand what war between insect\nand insectbetween insects snails and other animals with birds and\nbeasts of preyall striving to increase and all feeding on each other or\non the trees or their seeds and seedlings or on the other plants which\nfirst clothed the ground and thus checked the growth of the trees Throw up\na handful of feathers and all must fall to the ground according to\ndefinite laws but how simple is this problem compared to the action and\nreaction of the innumerable plants and animals which have determined in\nthe course of centuries the proportional numbers and kinds of trees now\ngrowing on the old Indian ruins\n\nThe dependency of one organic being on another as of a parasite on its\nprey lies generally between beings remote in the scale of nature This is\noften the case with those which may strictly be said to struggle with each\nother for existence as in the case of locusts and grassfeeding\nquadrupeds But the struggle almost invariably will be most severe between\nthe individuals of the same species for they frequent the same districts\nrequire the same food and are exposed to the same dangers In the case of\nvarieties of the same species the struggle will generally be almost\nequally severe and we sometimes see the contest soon decided for\ninstance if several varieties of wheat be sown together and the mixed\nseed be resown some of the varieties which best suit the soil or climate\nor are naturally the most fertile will beat the others and so yield more\nseed and will consequently in a few years quite supplant the other\nvarieties To keep up a mixed stock of even such extremely close varieties\nas the variously 76 coloured sweetpeas they must be each year harvested\nseparately and the seed then mixed in due proportion otherwise the weaker\nkinds will steadily decrease in numbers and disappear So again with the\nvarieties of sheep: it has been asserted that certain mountainvarieties\nwill starve out other mountainvarieties so that they cannot be kept\ntogether The same result has followed from keeping together different\nvarieties of the medicinal leech It may even be doubted whether the\nvarieties of any one of our domestic plants or animals have so exactly the\nsame strength habits and constitution that the original proportions of a\nmixed stock could be kept up for halfadozen generations if they were\nallowed to struggle together like beings in a state of nature and if the\nseed or young were not annually sorted\n\nAs species of the same genus have usually though by no means invariably\nsome similarity in habits and constitution and always in structure the\nstruggle will generally be more severe between species of the same genus\nwhen they come into competition with each other than between species of\ndistinct genera We see this in the recent extension over parts of the\nUnited States of one species of swallow having caused the decrease of\nanother species The recent increase of the misselthrush in parts of\nScotland has caused the decrease of the songthrush How frequently we hear\nof one species of rat taking the place of another species under the most\ndifferent climates In Russia the small Asiatic cockroach has everywhere\ndriven before it its great congener One species of charlock will supplant\nanother and so in other cases We can dimly see why the competition should\nbe most severe between allied forms which fill nearly the same place in\nthe economy of nature 77 but probably in no one case could we precisely\nsay why one species has been victorious over another in the great battle of\nlife\n\nA corollary of the highest importance may be deduced from the foregoing\nremarks namely that the structure of every organic being is related in\nthe most essential yet often hidden manner to that of all other organic\nbeings with which it comes into competition for food or residence or from\nwhich it has to escape or on which it preys This is obvious in the\nstructure of the teeth and talons of the tiger and in that of the legs and\nclaws of the parasite which clings to the hair on the tigers body But in\nthe beautifully plumed seed of the dandelion and in the flattened and\nfringed legs of the waterbeetle the relation seems at first confined to\nthe elements of air and water Yet the advantage of plumed seeds no doubt\nstands in the closest relation to the land being already thickly clothed by\nother plants so that the seeds may be widely distributed and fall on\nunoccupied ground In the waterbeetle the structure of its legs so well\nadapted for diving allows it to compete with other aquatic insects to\nhunt for its own prey and to escape serving as prey to other animals\n\nThe store of nutriment laid up within the seeds of many plants seems at\nfirst sight to have no sort of relation to other plants But from the\nstrong growth of young plants produced from such seeds as peas and beans\nwhen sown in the midst of long grass I suspect that the chief use of the\nnutriment in the seed is to favour the growth of the young seedling whilst\nstruggling with other plants growing vigorously all around\n\nLook at a plant in the midst of its range why does it not double or\nquadruple its numbers We know 78 that it can perfectly well withstand a\nlittle more heat or cold dampness or dryness for elsewhere it ranges into\nslightly hotter or colder damper or drier districts In this case we can\nclearly see that if we wished in imagination to give the plant the power of\nincreasing in number we should have to give it some advantage over its\ncompetitors or over the animals which preyed on it On the confines of its\ngeographical range a change of constitution with respect to climate would\nclearly be an advantage to our plant but we have reason to believe that\nonly a few plants or animals range so far that they are destroyed by the\nrigour of the climate alone Not until we reach the extreme confines of\nlife in the Arctic regions or on the borders of an utter desert will\ncompetition cease The land may be extremely cold or dry yet there will be\ncompetition between some few species or between the individuals of the\nsame species for the warmest or dampest spots\n\nHence also we can see that when a plant or animal is placed in a new\ncountry amongst new competitors though the climate may be exactly the same\nas in its former home yet the conditions of its life will generally be\nchanged in an essential manner If we wished to increase its average\nnumbers in its new home we should have to modify it in a different way to\nwhat we should have done in its native country for we should have to give\nit some advantage over a different set of competitors or enemies\n\nIt is good thus to try in our imagination to give any form some advantage\nover another Probably in no single instance should we know what to do so\nas to succeed It will convince us of our ignorance on the mutual relations\nof all organic beings a conviction as necessary as it seems to be\ndifficult to acquire All that we can do is to keep steadily in mind that\neach 79 organic being is striving to increase at a geometrical ratio\nthat each at some period of its life during some season of the year\nduring each generation or at intervals has to struggle for life and to\nsuffer great destruction When we reflect on this struggle we may console\nourselves with the full belief that the war of nature is not incessant\nthat no fear is felt that death is generally prompt and that the\nvigorous the healthy and the happy survive and multiply\n\n                                   \n\n\n80\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nNATURAL SELECTION\n\n    Natural Selectionits power compared with mans selectionits power\n    on

parentExplains the Grouping of all organic\n    beings\n\nHow will the struggle for existence discussed too briefly in the last\nchapter act in regard to variation Can the principle of selection which\nwe have seen is so potent in the hands of man apply in nature I think we\nshall see that it can act most effectually Let it be borne in mind in what\nan endless number of strange peculiarities our domestic productions and\nin a lesser degree those under nature vary and how strong the hereditary\ntendency is Under domestication it may be truly said that the whole\norganisation becomes in some degree plastic Let it be borne in mind how\ninfinitely complex and closefitting are the mutual relations of all\norganic beings to each other and to their physical conditions of life Can\nit then be thought improbable seeing that variations useful to man have\nundoubtedly occurred that other variations useful in some way to each\nbeing in the great and complex battle of life should sometimes occur in\nthe course of thousands of generations If such do occur can we doubt 81\nremembering that many more individuals are born than can possibly survive\nthat individuals having any advantage however slight over others would\nhave the best chance of surviving and of procreating their kind On the\nother hand we may feel sure that any variation in the least degree\ninjurious would be rigidly destroyed This preservation of favourable\nvariations and the rejection of injurious variations I call Natural\nSelection Variations neither useful nor injurious would not be affected by\nnatural selection and would be left a fluctuating element as perhaps we\nsee in the species called polymorphic\n\nWe shall best understand the probable course of natural selection by taking\nthe case of a country undergoing some physical change for instance of\nclimate The proportional numbers of its inhabitants would almost\nimmediately undergo a change and some species might become extinct We may\nconclude from what we have seen of the intimate and complex manner in\nwhich the inhabitants of each country are bound together that any change\nin the numerical proportions of some of the inhabitants independently of\nthe change of climate itself would seriously affect many of the others If\nthe country were open on its borders new forms would certainly immigrate\nand this also would seriously disturb the relations of some of the former\ninhabitants Let it be remembered how powerful the influence of a single\nintroduced tree or mammal has been shown to be But in the case of an\nisland or of a country partly surrounded by barriers into which new and\nbetter adapted forms could not freely enter we should then have places in\nthe economy of nature which would assuredly be better filled up if some of\nthe original inhabitants were in some manner modified for had the area\nbeen open to immigration these same 82 places would have been seized on\nby intruders In such case every slight modification which in the course\nof ages chanced to arise and which in any way favoured the individuals of\nany of the species by better adapting them to their altered conditions\nwould tend to be preserved and natural selection would thus have free\nscope for the work of improvement\n\nWe have reason to believe as stated in the first chapter that a change in\nthe conditions of life by specially acting on the reproductive system\ncauses or increases variability and in the foregoing case the conditions\nof life are supposed to have undergone a change and this would manifestly\nbe favourable to natural selection by giving a better chance of profitable\nvariations occurring and unless profitable variations do occur natural\nselection can do nothing Not that as I believe any extreme amount of\nvariability is necessary as man can certainly produce great results by\nadding up in any given direction mere individual differences so could\nNature but far more easily from having incomparably longer time at her\ndisposal Nor do I believe that any great physical change as of climate\nor any unusual degree of isolation to check immigration is actually\nnecessary to produce new and unoccupied places for natural selection to\nfill up by modifying and improving some of the varying inhabitants For as\nall the inhabitants of each country are struggling together with nicely\nbalanced forces extremely slight modifications in the structure or habits\nof one inhabitant would often give it an advantage over others and still\nfurther modifications of the same kind would often still further increase\nthe advantage No country can be named in which all the native inhabitants\nare now so perfectly adapted to each other and to the physical conditions\nunder which they live that none of 83 them could anyhow be improved for\nin all countries the natives have been so far conquered by naturalised\nproductions that they have allowed foreigners to take firm possession of\nthe land And as foreigners have thus everywhere beaten some of the\nnatives we may safely conclude that the natives might have been modified\nwith advantage so as to have better resisted such intruders\n\nAs man can produce and certainly has produced a great result by his\nmethodical and unconscious means of selection what may not Nature effect\nMan can act only on external and visible characters: Nature cares nothing\nfor appearances except in so far as they may be useful to any being She\ncan act on every internal organ on every shade of constitutional\ndifference on the whole machinery of life Man selects only for his own\ngood Nature only for that of the being which she tends Every selected\ncharacter is fully exercised by her and the being is placed under\nwellsuited conditions of life Man keeps the natives of many climates in\nthe same country he seldom exercises each selected character in some\npeculiar and fitting manner he feeds a long and a short beaked pigeon on\nthe same food he does not exercise a longbacked or longlegged quadruped\nin any peculiar manner he exposes sheep with long and short wool to the\nsame climate He does not allow the most vigorous males to struggle for the\nfemales He does not rigidly destroy all inferior animals but protects\nduring each varying season as far as lies in his power all his\nproductions He often begins his selection by some halfmonstrous form or\nat least by some modification prominent enough to catch his eye or to be\nplainly useful to him Under nature the slightest difference of structure\nor constitution may well turn the nicelybalanced scale in the struggle for\nlife and so be 84 preserved How fleeting are the wishes and efforts of\nman how short his time and consequently how poor will his products be\ncompared with those accumulated by Nature during whole geological periods\nCan we wonder then that Natures productions should be far truer in\ncharacter than mans productions that they should be infinitely better\nadapted to the most complex conditions of life and should plainly bear the\nstamp of far higher workmanship\n\nIt may metaphorically be said that natural selection is daily and hourly\nscrutinising throughout the world every variation even the slightest\nrejecting that which is bad preserving and adding up all that is good\nsilently and insensibly working whenever and wherever opportunity offers\nat the improvement of each organic being in relation to its organic and\ninorganic conditions of life We see nothing of these slow changes in\nprogress until the hand of time has marked the long lapse of ages and\nthen so imperfect is our view into long past geological ages that we only\nsee that the forms of life are now different from what they formerly were\n\nAlthough natural selection can act only through and for the good of each\nbeing yet characters and structures which we are apt to consider as of\nvery trifling importance may thus be acted on When we see leafeating\ninsects green and barkfeeders mottledgrey the alpine ptarmigan white in\nwinter the redgrouse the colour of heather and the blackgrouse that of\npeaty earth we must believe that these tints are of service to these birds\nand insects in preserving them from danger Grouse if not destroyed at\nsome period of their lives would increase in countless numbers they are\nknown to suffer largely from birds of prey and hawks are guided by\neyesight to their preyso much so that on 85 parts of the Continent\npersons are warned not to keep white pigeons as being the most liable to\ndestruction Hence I can see no reason to doubt that natural selection\nmight be most effective in giving the proper colour to each kind of grouse\nand in keeping that colour when once acquired true and constant Nor\nought we to think that the occasional destruction of an animal of any\nparticular colour would produce little effect: we should remember how\nessential it is in a flock of white sheep to destroy every lamb with the\nfaintest trace of black In plants the down on the fruit and the colour of\nthe flesh are considered by botanists as characters of the most trifling\nimportance: yet we hear from an excellent horticulturist Downing that in\nthe United States smoothskinned fruits suffer far more from a beetle a\ncurculio than those with down that purple plums suffer far more from a\ncertain disease than yellow plums whereas another disease attacks\nyellowfleshed peaches far more than those with other coloured flesh If\nwith all the aids of art these slight differences make a great difference\nin cultivating the several varieties assuredly in a state of nature\nwhere the trees would have to struggle with other trees and with a host of\nenemies such differences would effectually settle which variety whether a\nsmooth or downy a yellow or purple fleshed fruit should succeed\n\nIn looking at many small points of difference between species which as\nfar as our ignorance permits us to judge seem quite unimportant we must\nnot forget that climate food c probably produce some slight and direct\neffect It is however far more necessary to bear in mind that there are\nmany unknown laws of correlation of growth which when one part of the\norganisation is modified through variation and the modifications are\naccumulated by natural selection for 86 the good of the being will cause\nother modifications often of the most unexpected nature\n\nAs we see that those variations which under domestication appear at any\nparticular period of life tend to reappear in the offspring at the same\nperiodfor instance in the seeds of the many varieties of our culinary\nand agricultural plants in the caterpillar and cocoon stages of the\nvarieties of the silkworm in the eggs of poultry and in the colour of the\ndown of their chickens in the horns of our sheep and cattle when nearly\nadultso in a state of nature natural selection will be enabled to act\non and modify organic beings at any age by the accumulation of variations\nprofitable at that age and by their inheritance at a corresponding age If\nit profit a plant to have its seeds more and more widely disseminated by\nthe wind I can see no greater difficulty in this being effected through\nnatural selection than in the cottonplanter increasing and improving by\nselection the down in the pods on his cottontrees Natural selection may\nmodify and adapt the larva of an insect to a score of contingencies wholly\ndifferent from those which concern the mature insect These modifications\nwill no doubt affect through the laws of correlation the structure of the\nadult and probably in the case of those insects which live only for a few\nhours and which never feed a large part of their structure is merely the\ncorrelated result of successive changes in the structure of their larv\nSo conversely modifications in the adult will probably often affect the\nstructure of the larva but in all cases natural selection will ensure that\nmodifications consequent on other modifications at a different period of\nlife shall not be in the least degree injurious: for if they became so\nthey would cause the extinction of the species\n\nNatural selection will modify the structure of the 87 young in relation\nto the parent and of the parent in relation to the young In social\nanimals it will adapt the structure of each individual for the benefit of\nthe community if each in consequence profits by the selected change What\nnatural selection cannot do is to modify the structure of one species\nwithout giving it any advantage for the good of another species and\nthough statements to this effect may be found in works of natural history\nI cannot find one case which will bear investigation A structure used only\nonce in an animals whole life if of high importance to it might be\nmodified to any extent by natural selection for instance the great jaws\npossessed by certain insects used exclusively for opening the cocoonor\nthe hard tip to the beak of nestling birds used for breaking the egg It\nhas been asserted that of the best shortbeaked tumblerpigeons more\nperish in the egg than are able to get out of it so that fanciers assist\nin the act of hatching Now if nature had to make the beak of a fullgrown\npigeon very short for the birds own advantage the process of modification\nwould be very slow and there would be simultaneously the most rigorous\nselection of the young birds within the egg which had the most powerful\nand hardest beaks for all with weak beaks would inevitably perish: or\nmore delicate and more easily broken shells might be selected the\nthickness of the shell being known to vary like every other structure\n\n\n\nSexual SelectionInasmuch as peculiarities often appear under\ndomestication in one sex and become hereditarily attached to that sex the\nsame fact probably occurs under nature and if so natural selection will\nbe able to modify one sex in its functional relations to the other sex or\nin relation to wholly different habits of life in the two sexes as is\nsometimes the case 88 with insects And this leads me to say a few words\non what I call Sexual Selection This depends not on a struggle for\nexistence but on a struggle between the males for possession of the\nfemales the result is not death to the unsuccessful competitor but few or\nno offspring Sexual selection is therefore less rigorous than natural\nselection Generally the most vigorous males those which are best fitted\nfor their places in nature will leave most progeny But in many cases\nvictory depends not on general vigour but on having special weapons\nconfined to the male sex A hornless stag or spurless cock would have a\npoor chance of leaving offspring Sexual selection by always allowing the\nvictor to breed might surely give indomitable courage length to the spur\nand strength to the wing to strike in the spurred leg as well as the\nbrutal cockfighter who knows well that he can improve his breed by\ncareful selection of the best cocks How low in the scale of nature the law\nof battle descends I know not male alligators have been described as\nfighting bellowing and whirling round like Indians in a wardance for\nthe possession of the females male salmons have been seen fighting all day\nlong male stagbeetles often bear wounds from the huge mandibles of other\nmales The war is perhaps severest between the males of polygamous\nanimals and these seem oftenest provided with special weapons The males\nof carnivorous animals are already well armed though to them and to\nothers special means of defence may be given through means of sexual\nselection as the mane to the lion the shoulderpad to the boar and the\nhooked jaw to the male salmon for the shield may be as important for\nvictory as the sword or spear\n\nAmongst birds the contest is often of a more peaceful character All those\nwho have attended to the subject 89 believe that there is the severest\nrivalry between the males of many species to attract by singing the\nfemales The rockthrush of Guiana birds of Paradise and some others\ncongregate and successive males display their gorgeous plumage and perform\nstrange antics before the females which standing by as spectators at\nlast choose the most attractive partner Those who have closely attended to\nbirds in confinement well know that they often take individual preferences\nand dislikes: thus Sir R Heron has described how one pied peacock was\neminently attractive to all his hen birds It may appear childish to\nattribute any effect to such apparently weak means: I cannot here enter on\nthe details necessary to support this view but if man can in a short time\ngive elegant carriage and beauty to his bantams according to his standard\nof beauty I can see no good reason to doubt that female birds by\nselecting during thousands of generations the most melodious or beautiful\nmales according to their standard of beauty might produce a marked\neffect I strongly suspect that some wellknown laws with respect to the\nplumage of male and female birds in comparison with the plumage of the\nyoung can be explained on the view of plumage having been chiefly modified\nby sexual selection acting when the birds have come to the breeding age or\nduring the breeding season the modifications thus produced being inherited\nat corresponding ages or seasons either by the males alone or by the\nmales and females but I have not space here to enter on this subject\n\nThus it is as I believe that when the males and females of any animal\nhave the same general habits of life but differ in structure colour or\nornament such differences have been mainly caused by sexual selection\nthat is individual males have had in successive generations some slight\nadvantage over other 90 males in their weapons means of defence or\ncharms and have transmitted these advantages to their male offspring Yet\nI would not wish to attribute all such sexual differences to this agency:\nfor we see peculiarities arising and becoming attached to the male sex in\nour domestic animals as the wattle in male carriers hornlike\nprotuberances in the cocks of certain fowls c which we cannot believe\nto be either useful to the males in battle or attractive to the females\nWe see analogous cases under nature for instance the tuft of hair on the\nbreast of the turkeycock which can hardly be either useful or ornamental\nto this birdindeed had the tuft appeared under domestication it would\nhave been called a monstrosity\n\n\n\nIllustrations of the action of Natural SelectionIn order to make it\nclear how as I believe natural selection acts I must beg permission to\ngive one or two imaginary illustrations Let us take the case of a wolf\nwhich preys on various animals securing some by craft some by strength\nand some by fleetness and let us suppose that the fleetest prey a deer\nfor instance had from any change in the country increased in numbers or\nthat other prey had decreased in numbers during that season of the year\nwhen the wolf is hardest pressed for food I can under such circumstances\nsee no reason to doubt that the swiftest and slimmest wolves would have the\nbest chance of surviving and so be preserved or selectedprovided always\nthat they retained strength to master their prey at this or at some other\nperiod of the year when they might be compelled to prey on other animals\nI can see no more reason to doubt this than that man can improve the\nfleetness of his greyhounds by careful and methodical selection or by that\nunconscious selection which results from each man trying 91 to keep the\nbest dogs without any thought of modifying the breed\n\nEven without any change in the proportional numbers of the animals on which\nour wolf preyed a cub might be born with an innate tendency to pursue\ncertain kinds of prey Nor can this be thought very improbable for we\noften observe great differences in the natural tendencies of our domestic\nanimals one cat for instance taking to catch rats another mice one\ncat according to Mr St John bringing home winged game another hares or\nrabbits and another hunting on marshy ground and almost nightly catching\nwoodcocks or snipes The tendency to catch rats rather than mice is known\nto be inherited Now if any slight innate change of habit or of structure\nbenefited an individual wolf it would have the best chance of surviving\nand of leaving offspring Some of its young would probably inherit the same\nhabits or structure and by the repetition of this process a new variety\nmight be formed which would either supplant or coexist with the parent form\nof wolf Or again the wolves inhabiting a mountainous district and those\nfrequenting the lowlands would naturally be forced to hunt different prey\nand from the continued preservation of the individuals best fitted for the\ntwo sites two varieties might slowly be formed These varieties would\ncross and blend where they met but to this subject of intercrossing we\nshall soon have to return I may add that according to Mr Pierce there\nare two varieties of the wolf inhabiting the Catskill Mountains in the\nUnited States one with a light greyhoundlike form which pursues deer\nand the other more bulky with shorter legs which more frequently attacks\nthe shepherds flocks\n\nLet us now take a more complex case Certain plants excrete a sweet juice\napparently for the sake of eliminating something injurious from their sap:\nthis is 92 effected by glands at the base of the stipules in some\nLeguminos and at the back of the leaf of the common laurel This juice\nthough small in quantity is greedily sought by insects Let us now suppose\na little sweet juice or nectar to be excreted by the inner bases of the\npetals of a flower In this case insects in seeking the nectar would get\ndusted with pollen and would certainly often transport the pollen from one\nflower to the stigma of another flower The flowers of two distinct\nindividuals of the same species would thus get crossed and the act of\ncrossing we have good reason to believe as will hereafter be more fully\nalluded to would produce very vigorous seedlings which consequently\nwould have the best chance of flourishing and surviving Some of these\nseedlings would probably inherit the nectarexcreting power Those\nindividual flowers which had the largest glands or nectaries and which\nexcreted most nectar would be oftenest visited by insects and would be\noftenest crossed and so in the longrun would gain the upper hand Those\nflowers also which had their stamens and pistils placed in relation to\nthe size and habits of the particular insects which visited them so as to\nfavour in any degree the transportal of their pollen from flower to flower\nwould likewise be favoured or selected We might have taken the case of\ninsects visiting flowers for the sake of collecting pollen instead of\nnectar and as pollen is formed for the sole object of fertilisation its\ndestruction appears a simple loss to the plant yet if a little pollen were\ncarried at first occasionally and then habitually by the pollendevouring\ninsects from flower to flower and a cross thus effected although\nninetenths of the pollen were destroyed it might still be a great gain to\nthe plant and those individuals which produced more and more pollen and\nhad larger and larger anthers would be selected 93\n\nWhen our plant by this process of the continued preservation or natural\nselection of more and more attractive flowers had been rendered highly\nattractive to insects they would unintentionally on their part regularly\ncarry pollen from flower to flower and that they can most effectually do\nthis I could easily show by many striking instances I will give only\nonenot as a very striking case but as likewise illustrating one step in\nthe separation of the sexes of plants presently to be alluded to Some\nhollytrees bear only male flowers which have four stamens producing a\nrather small quantity of pollen and a rudimentary pistil other\nhollytrees bear only female flowers these have a fullsized pistil and\nfour stamens with shrivelled anthers in which not a grain of pollen can be\ndetected Having found a female tree exactly sixty yards from a male tree\nI put the stigmas of twenty flowers taken from different branches under\nthe microscope and on all without exception there were pollengrains\nand on some a profusion of pollen As the wind had set for several days\nfrom the female to the male tree the pollen could not thus have been\ncarried The weather had been cold and boisterous and therefore not\nfavourable to bees nevertheless every female flower which I examined had\nbeen effectually fertilised by the bees accidentally dusted with pollen\nhaving flown from tree to tree in search of nectar But to return to our\nimaginary case: as soon as the plant had been rendered so highly attractive\nto insects that pollen was regularly carried from flower to flower another\nprocess might commence No naturalist doubts the advantage of what has been\ncalled the physiological division of labour hence we may believe that it\nwould be advantageous to a plant to produce stamens alone in one flower or\non one whole plant and pistils alone in 94 another flower or on another\nplant In plants under culture and placed under new conditions of life\nsometimes the male organs and sometimes the female organs become more or\nless impotent now if we suppose this to occur in ever so slight a degree\nunder nature then as pollen is already carried regularly from flower to\nflower and as a more complete separation of the sexes of our plant would\nbe advantageous on the principle of the division of labour individuals\nwith this tendency more and more increased would be continually favoured\nor selected until at last a complete separation of the sexes would be\neffected\n\nLet us now turn to the nectarfeeding insects in our imaginary case: we may\nsuppose the plant of which we have been slowly increasing the nectar by\ncontinued selection to be a common plant and that certain insects\ndepended in main part on its nectar for food I could give many facts\nshowing how anxious bees are to save time for instance their habit of\ncutting holes and sucking the nectar at the bases of certain flowers which\nthey can with a very little more trouble enter by the mouth Bearing such\nfacts in mind I can see no reason to doubt that an accidental deviation in\nthe size and form of the body or in the curvature and length of the\nproboscis c far too slight to be appreciated by us might profit a bee\nor other insect so that an individual so characterised would be able to\nobtain its food more quickly and so have a better chance of living and\nleaving descendants Its descendants would probably inherit a tendency to a\nsimilar slight deviation of structure The tubes of the corollas of the\ncommon red and incarnate clovers Trifolium pratense and incarnatum do not\non a hasty glance appear to differ in length yet the hivebee can easily\nsuck the nectar out of the incarnate clover but not out of the common red\n95 clover which is visited by humblebees alone so that whole fields of\nthe red clover offer in vain an abundant supply of precious nectar to the\nhivebee Thus it might be a great advantage to the hivebee to have a\nslightly longer or differently constructed proboscis On the other hand I\nhave found by experiment that the fertility of clover depends on bees\nvisiting and moving parts of the corolla so as to push the pollen on to\nthe stigmatic surface Hence again if humblebees were to become rare in\nany country it might be a great advantage to the red clover to have a\nshorter or more deeply divided tube to its corolla so that the hivebee\ncould visit its flowers Thus I can understand how a flower and a bee might\nslowly become either simultaneously or one after the other modified and\nadapted in the most perfect manner to each other by the continued\npreservation of individuals presenting mutual and slightly favourable\ndeviations of structure\n\nI am well aware that this doctrine of natural selection exemplified in the\nabove imaginary instances is open to the same objections which were at\nfirst urged against Sir Charles Lyells noble views on the modern changes\nof the earth as illustrative of geology but we now seldom hear the\naction for instance of the coastwaves called a trifling and\ninsignificant cause when applied to the excavation of gigantic valleys or\nto the formation of the longest lines of inland cliffs Natural selection\ncan act only by the preservation and accumulation of infinitesimally small\ninherited modifications each profitable to the preserved being and as\nmodern geology has almost banished such views as the excavation of a great\nvalley by a single diluvial wave so will natural selection if it be a\ntrue principle banish the belief of the continued creation of new organic\n96 beings or of any great and sudden modification in their structure\n\n\n\nOn the Intercrossing of IndividualsI must here introduce a short\ndigression In the case of animals and plants with separated sexes it is\nof course obvious that two individuals must always with the exception of\nthe curious and not wellunderstood cases of parthenogenesis unite for\neach birth but in the case of hermaphrodites this is far from obvious\nNevertheless I am strongly inclined to believe that with all hermaphrodites\ntwo individuals either occasionally or habitually concur for the\nreproduction of their kind This view was first suggested by Andrew Knight\nWe shall presently see its importance but I must here treat the subject\nwith extreme brevity though I have the materials prepared for an ample\ndiscussion All vertebrate animals all insects and some other large\ngroups of animals pair for each birth Modern research has much diminished\nthe number of supposed hermaphrodites and of real hermaphrodites a large\nnumber pair that is two individuals regularly unite for reproduction\nwhich is all that concerns us But still there are many hermaphrodite\nanimals which certainly do not habitually pair and a vast majority of\nplants are hermaphrodites What reason it may be asked is there for\nsupposing in these cases that two individuals ever concur in reproduction\nAs it is impossible here to enter on details I must trust to some general\nconsiderations alone\n\nIn the first place I have collected so large a body of facts showing in\naccordance with the almost universal belief of breeders that with animals\nand plants a cross between different varieties or between individuals of\nthe same variety but of another strain gives vigour and 97 fertility to\nthe offspring and on the other hand that close interbreeding diminishes\nvigour and fertility that these facts alone incline me to believe that it\nis a general law of nature utterly ignorant though we be of the meaning of\nthe law that no organic being selffertilises itself for an eternity of\ngenerations but that a cross with another individual is\noccasionallyperhaps at very long intervalsindispensable\n\nOn the belief that this is a law of nature we can I think understand\nseveral large classes of facts such as the following which on any other\nview are inexplicable Every hybridizer knows how unfavourable exposure to\nwet is to the fertilisation of a flower yet what a multitude of flowers\nhave their anthers and stigmas fully exposed to the weather but if an\noccasional cross be indispensable the fullest freedom for the entrance of\npollen from another individual will explain this state of exposure more\nespecially as the plants own anthers and pistil generally stand so close\ntogether that selffertilisation seems almost inevitable Many flowers on\nthe other hand have their organs of fructification closely enclosed as in\nthe great papilionaceous or peafamily but in several perhaps in all\nsuch flowers there is a very curious adaptation between the structure of\nthe flower and the manner in which bees suck the nectar for in doing\nthis they either push the flowers own pollen on the stigma or bring\npollen from another flower So necessary are the visits of bees to\npapilionaceous flowers that I have found by experiments published\nelsewhere that their fertility is greatly diminished if these visits be\nprevented Now it is scarcely possible that bees should fly from flower to\nflower and not carry pollen from one to the other to the great good as I\nbelieve of the plant Bees will act like a camelhair pencil and it is\nquite sufficient just to touch the anthers of 98 one flower and then the\nstigma of another with the same brush to ensure fertilisation but it must\nnot be supposed that bees would thus produce a multitude of hybrids between\ndistinct species for if you bring on the same brush a plants own pollen\nand pollen from another species the former will have such a prepotent\neffect that it will invariably and completely destroy as has been shown\nby Grtner any influence from the foreign pollen\n\nWhen the stamens of a flower suddenly spring towards the pistil or slowly\nmove one after the other towards it the contrivance seems adapted solely\nto ensure selffertilisation and no doubt it is useful for this end: but\nthe agency of insects is often required to cause the stamens to spring\nforward as Klreuter has shown to be the case with the barberry and in\nthis very genus which seems to have a special contrivance for\nselffertilisation it is well known that if closelyallied forms or\nvarieties are planted near each other it is hardly possible to raise pure\nseedlings so largely do they naturally cross In many other cases far\nfrom there being any aids for selffertilisation there are special\ncontrivances as I could show from the writings of C C Sprengel and from\nmy own observations which effectually prevent the stigma receiving pollen\nfrom its own flower: for instance in Lobelia fulgens there is a really\nbeautiful and elaborate contrivance by which every one of the infinitely\nnumerous pollengranules are swept out of the conjoined anthers of each\nflower before the stigma of that individual flower is ready to receive\nthem and as this flower is never visited at least in my garden by\ninsects it never sets a seed though by placing pollen from one flower on\nthe stigma of another I raised plenty of seedlings and whilst another\nspecies of Lobelia growing close by which is visited by bees seeds\nfreely In very many other cases though there 99 be no special\nmechanical contrivance to prevent the stigma of a flower receiving its own\npollen yet as C C Sprengel has shown and as I can confirm either the\nanthers burst before the stigma is ready for fertilisation or the stigma\nis ready before the pollen of that flower is ready so that these plants\nhave in fact separated sexes and must habitually be crossed How strange\nare these facts How strange that the pollen and stigmatic surface of the\nsame flower though placed so close together as if for the very purpose of\nselffertilisation should in so many cases be mutually useless to each\nother How simply are these facts explained on the view of an occasional\ncross with a distinct individual being advantageous or indispensable\n\nIf several varieties of the cabbage radish onion and of some other\nplants be allowed to seed near each other a large majority as I have\nfound of the seedlings thus raised will turn out mongrels: for instance I\nraised 233 seedling cabbages from some plants of different varieties\ngrowing near each other and of these only 78 were true to their kind and\nsome even of these were not perfectly true Yet the pistil of each\ncabbageflower is surrounded not only by its own six stamens but by those\nof the many other flowers on the same plant How then comes it that such\na vast number of the seedlings are mongrelized I suspect that it must\narise from the pollen of a distinct variety having a prepotent effect\nover a flowers own pollen and that this is part of the general law of\ngood being derived from the intercrossing of distinct individuals of the\nsame species When distinct species are crossed the case is directly the\nreverse for a plants own pollen is always prepotent over foreign pollen\nbut to this subject we shall return in a future chapter\n\nIn the case of a gigantic tree covered with 100 innumerable flowers it\nmay be objected that pollen could seldom be carried from tree to tree and\nat most only from flower to flower on the same tree and that flowers on\nthe same tree can be considered as distinct individuals only in a limited\nsense I believe this objection to be valid but that nature has largely\nprovided against it by giving to trees a strong tendency to bear flowers\nwith separated sexes When the sexes are separated although the male and\nfemale flowers may be produced on the same tree we can see that pollen\nmust be regularly carried from flower to flower and this will give a\nbetter chance of pollen being occasionally carried from tree to tree That\ntrees belonging to all Orders have their sexes more often separated than\nother plants I find to be the case in this country and at my request Dr\nHooker tabulated the trees of New Zealand and Dr Asa Gray those of the\nUnited States and the result was as I anticipated On the other hand Dr\nHooker has recently informed me that he finds that the rule does not hold\nin Australia and I have made these few remarks on the sexes of trees\nsimply to call attention to the subject\n\nTurning for a very brief space to animals: on the land there are some\nhermaphrodites as landmollusca and earthworms but these all pair As\nyet I have not found a single case of a terrestrial animal which fertilises\nitself We can understand this remarkable fact which offers so strong a\ncontrast with terrestrial plants on the view of an occasional cross being\nindispensable by considering the medium in which terrestrial animals live\nand the nature of the fertilising element for we know of no means\nanalogous to the action of insects and of the wind in the case of plants\nby which an occasional cross could be effected with terrestrial animals\nwithout the concurrence of two individuals Of aquatic animals there are\nmany selffertilising hermaphrodites but here 101 currents in the water\noffer an obvious means for an occasional cross And as in the case of\nflowers I have as yet failed after consultation with one of the highest\nauthorities namely Professor Huxley to discover a single case of an\nhermaphrodite animal with the organs of reproduction so perfectly enclosed\nwithin the body that access from without and the occasional influence of a\ndistinct individual can be shown to be physically impossible Cirripedes\nlong appeared to me to present a case of very great difficulty under this\npoint of view but I have been enabled by a fortunate chance elsewhere to\nprove that two individuals though both are selffertilising\nhermaphrodites do sometimes cross\n\nIt must have struck most naturalists as a strange anomaly that in the case\nof both animals and plants species of the same family and even of the same\ngenus though agreeing closely with each other in almost their whole\norganisation yet are not rarely some of them hermaphrodites and some of\nthem unisexual But if in fact all hermaphrodites do occasionally\nintercross with other individuals the difference between hermaphrodites\nand unisexual species as far as function is concerned becomes very small\n\nFrom these several considerations and from the many special facts which I\nhave collected but which I am not here able to give I am strongly\ninclined to suspect that both in the vegetable and animal kingdoms an\noccasional intercross with a distinct individual is a law of nature I am\nwell aware that there are on this view many cases of difficulty some of\nwhich I am trying to investigate Finally then we may conclude that in\nmany organic beings a cross between two individuals is an obvious\nnecessity for each birth in many others it occurs perhaps only at long\nintervals but in none as I suspect can selffertilisation go on for\nperpetuity 102\n\n\n\nCircumstances favourable to Natural SelectionThis is an extremely\nintricate subject A large amount of inheritable and diversified\nvariability is favourable but I believe mere individual differences\nsuffice for the work A large number of individuals by giving a better\nchance for the appearance within any given period of profitable variations\nwill compensate for a lesser amount of variability in each individual and\nis I believe an extremely important element of success Though nature\ngrants vast periods of time for the work of natural selection she does not\ngrant an indefinite period for as all organic beings are striving it may\nbe said to seize on each place in the economy of nature if any one\nspecies does not become modified and improved in a corresponding degree\nwith its competitors it will soon be exterminated\n\nIn mans methodical selection a breeder selects for some definite object\nand free intercrossing will wholly stop his work But when many men\nwithout intending to alter the breed have a nearly common standard of\nperfection and all try to get and breed from the best animals much\nimprovement and modification surely but slowly follow from this unconscious\nprocess of selection notwithstanding a large amount of crossing with\ninferior animals Thus it will be in nature for within a confined area\nwith some place in its polity not so perfectly occupied as might be\nnatural selection will always tend to preserve all the individuals varying\nin the right direction though in different degrees so as better to fill\nup the unoccupied place But if the area be large its several districts\nwill almost certainly present different conditions of life and then if\nnatural selection be modifying and improving a species in the several\ndistricts there will be intercrossing with the other individuals of the\nsame species on the confines of each And in 103 this case the effects of\nintercrossing can hardly be counterbalanced by natural selection always\ntending to modify all the individuals in each district in exactly the same\nmanner to the conditions of each for in a continuous area the physical\nconditions at least will generally graduate away insensibly from one\ndistrict to another The intercrossing will most affect those animals which\nunite for each birth which wander much and which do not breed at a very\nquick rate Hence in animals of this nature for instance in birds\nvarieties will generally be confined to separated countries and this I\nbelieve to be the case In hermaphrodite organisms which cross only\noccasionally and likewise in animals which unite for each birth but which\nwander little and which can increase at a very rapid rate a new and\nimproved variety might be quickly formed on any one spot and might there\nmaintain itself in a body so that whatever intercrossing took place would\nbe chiefly between the individuals of the same new variety A local variety\nwhen once thus formed might subsequently slowly spread to other districts\nOn the above principle nurserymen always prefer getting seed from a large\nbody of plants of the same variety as the chance of intercrossing with\nother varieties is thus lessened\n\nEven in the case of slowbreeding animals which unite for each birth we\nmust not overrate the effects of intercrosses in retarding natural\nselection for I can bring a considerable catalogue of facts showing that\nwithin the same area varieties of the same animal can long remain\ndistinct from haunting different stations from breeding at slightly\ndifferent seasons or from varieties of the same kind preferring to pair\ntogether\n\nIntercrossing plays a very important part in nature in keeping the\nindividuals of the same species or of the same variety true and uniform\nin character It will 104 obviously thus act far more efficiently with\nthose animals which unite for each birth but I have already attempted to\nshow that we have reason to believe that occasional intercrosses take place\nwith all animals and with all plants Even if these take place only at long\nintervals I am convinced that the young thus produced will gain so much in\nvigour and fertility over the offspring from longcontinued\nselffertilisation that they will have a better chance of surviving and\npropagating their kind and thus in the long run the influence of\nintercrosses even at rare intervals will be great If there exist organic\nbeings which never intercross uniformity of character can be retained\namongst them as long as their conditions of life remain the same only\nthrough the principle of inheritance and through natural selection\ndestroying any which depart from the proper type but if their conditions\nof life change and they undergo modification uniformity of character can\nbe given to their modified offspring solely by natural selection\npreserving the same favourable variations\n\nIsolation also is an important element in the process of natural\nselection In a confined or isolated area if not very large the organic\nand inorganic conditions of life will generally be in a great degree\nuniform so that natural selection will tend to modify all the individuals\nof a varying species throughout the area in the same manner in relation to\nthe same conditions Intercrosses also with the individuals of the same\nspecies which otherwise would have inhabited the surrounding and\ndifferently circumstanced districts will be prevented But isolation\nprobably acts more efficiently in checking the immigration of better\nadapted organisms after any physical change such as of climate or\nelevation of the land c and thus new places in the natural economy of\nthe country are left open for the old inhabitants to struggle for and\nbecome adapted to through 105 modifications in their structure and\nconstitution Lastly isolation by checking immigration and consequently\ncompetition will give time for any new variety to be slowly improved and\nthis may sometimes be of importance in the production of new species If\nhowever an isolated area be very small either from being surrounded by\nbarriers or from having very peculiar physical conditions the total\nnumber of the individuals supported on it will necessarily be very small\nand fewness of individuals will greatly retard the production of new\nspecies through natural selection by decreasing the chance of the\nappearance of favourable variations\n\nIf we turn to nature to test the truth of these remarks and look at any\nsmall isolated area such as an oceanic island although the total number\nof the species inhabiting it will be found to be small as we shall see in\nour chapter on geographical distribution yet of these species a very large\nproportion are endemicthat is have been produced there and nowhere\nelse Hence an oceanic island at first sight seems to have been highly\nfavourable for the production of new species But we may thus greatly\ndeceive ourselves for to ascertain whether a small isolated area or a\nlarge open area like a continent has been most favourable for the\nproduction of new organic forms we ought to make the comparison within\nequal times and this we are incapable of doing\n\nAlthough I do not doubt that isolation is of considerable importance in the\nproduction of new species on the whole I am inclined to believe that\nlargeness of area is of more importance more especially in the production\nof species which will prove capable of enduring for a long period and of\nspreading widely Throughout a great and open area not only will there be\na better chance of favourable variations arising from the large number of\nindividuals of the same species 106 there supported but the conditions\nof life are infinitely complex from the large number of already existing\nspecies and if some of these many species become modified and improved\nothers will have to be improved in a corresponding degree or they will be\nexterminated Each new form also as soon as it has been much improved\nwill be able to spread over the open and continuous area and will thus\ncome into competition with many others Hence more new places will be\nformed and the competition to fill them will be more severe on a large\nthan on a small and isolated area Moreover great areas though now\ncontinuous owing to oscillations of level will often have recently\nexisted in a broken condition so that the good effects of isolation will\ngenerally to a certain extent have concurred Finally I conclude that\nalthough small isolated areas probably have been in some respects highly\nfavourable for the production of new species yet that the course of\nmodification will generally have been more rapid on large areas and what\nis more important that the new forms produced on large areas which\nalready have been victorious over many competitors will be those that will\nspread most widely will give rise to most new varieties and species and\nwill thus play an important part in the changing history of the organic\nworld\n\nWe can perhaps on these views understand some facts which will be again\nalluded to in our chapter on geographical distribution for instance that\nthe productions of the smaller continent of Australia have formerly\nyielded and apparently are now yielding before those of the larger\nEuropoAsiatic area Thus also it is that continental productions have\neverywhere become so largely naturalised on islands On a small island the\nrace for life will have been less severe and there will have been less\nmodification and less 107 extermination Hence perhaps it comes that\nthe flora of Madeira according to Oswald Heer resembles the extinct\ntertiary flora of Europe All freshwater basins taken together make a\nsmall area compared with that of the sea or of the land and consequently\nthe competition between freshwater productions will have been less severe\nthan elsewhere new forms will have been more slowly formed and old forms\nmore slowly exterminated And it is in fresh water that we find seven\ngenera of Ganoid fishes remnants of a once preponderant order: and in\nfresh water we find some of the most anomalous forms now known in the\nworld as the Ornithorhynchus and Lepidosiren which like fossils connect\nto a certain extent orders now widely separated in the natural scale These\nanomalous forms may almost be called living fossils they have endured to\nthe present day from having inhabited a confined area and from having\nthus been exposed to less severe competition\n\nTo sum up the circumstances favourable and unfavourable to natural\nselection as far as the extreme intricacy of the subject permits I\nconclude looking to the future that for terrestrial productions a large\ncontinental area which will probably undergo many oscillations of level\nand which consequently will exist for long periods in a broken condition\nis the most favourable for the production of many new forms of life likely\nto endure long and to spread widely For the area first existed as a\ncontinent and the inhabitants at this period numerous in individuals and\nkinds will have been subjected to very severe competition When converted\nby subsidence into large separate islands there will still exist many\nindividuals of the same species on each island: intercrossing on the\nconfines of the range of each species will thus be checked: after physical\nchanges of any kind immigration will be 108 prevented so that new\nplaces in the polity of each island will have to be filled up by\nmodifications of the old inhabitants and time will be allowed for the\nvarieties in each to become well modified and perfected When by renewed\nelevation the islands shall be reconverted into a continental area there\nwill again be severe competition: the most favoured or improved varieties\nwill be enabled to spread: there will be much extinction of the less\nimproved forms and the relative proportional numbers of the various\ninhabitants of the renewed continent will again be changed and again there\nwill be a fair field for natural selection to improve still further the\ninhabitants and thus produce new species\n\nThat natural selection will always act with extreme slowness I fully\nadmit Its action depends on there being places in the polity of nature\nwhich can be better occupied by some of the inhabitants of the country\nundergoing modification of some kind The existence of such places will\noften depend on physical changes which are generally very slow and on the\nimmigration of better adapted forms having been checked But the action of\nnatural selection will probably still oftener depend on some of the\ninhabitants becoming slowly modified the mutual relations of many of the\nother inhabitants being thus disturbed Nothing can be effected unless\nfavourable variations occur and variation itself is apparently always a\nvery slow process The process will often be greatly retarded by free\nintercrossing Many will exclaim that these several causes are amply\nsufficient wholly to stop the action of natural selection I do not believe\nso On the other hand I do believe that natural selection always acts very\nslowly often only at long intervals of time and generally on only a very\nfew of the inhabitants of the same region at the same time I further\nbelieve that this very slow 109 intermittent action of natural\nselection accords perfectly well with what geology tells us of the rate and\nmanner at which the inhabitants of this world have changed\n\nSlow though the process of selection may be if feeble man can do much by\nhis powers of artificial selection I can see no limit to the amount of\nchange to the beauty and infinite complexity of the coadaptations between\nall organic beings one with another and with their physical conditions of\nlife which may be effected in the long course of time by natures power of\nselection\n\n\n\nExtinctionThis subject will be more fully discussed in our chapter on\nGeology but it must be here alluded to from being intimately connected\nwith natural selection Natural selection acts solely through the\npreservation of variations in some way advantageous which consequently\nendure But as from the high geometrical ratio of increase of all organic\nbeings each area is already fully stocked with inhabitants it follows\nthat as each selected and favoured form increases in number so will the\nless favoured forms decrease and become rare Rarity as geology tells us\nis the precursor to extinction We can also see that any form represented\nby few individuals will during fluctuations in the seasons or in the\nnumber of its enemies run a good chance of utter extinction But we may go\nfurther than this for as new forms are continually and slowly being\nproduced unless we believe that the number of specific forms goes on\nperpetually and almost indefinitely increasing numbers inevitably must\nbecome extinct That the number of specific forms has not indefinitely\nincreased geology shows us plainly and indeed we can see reason why they\nshould not have thus increased for the number of places in the polity of\nnature is not indefinitely greatnot that we 110 have any means of\nknowing that any one region has as yet got its maximum of species Probably\nno region is as yet fully stocked for at the Cape of Good Hope where more\nspecies of plants are crowded together than in any other quarter of the\nworld some foreign plants have become naturalised without causing as far\nas we know the extinction of any natives\n\nFurthermore the species which are most numerous in individuals will have\nthe best chance of producing within any given period favourable variations\nWe have evidence of this in the facts given in the second chapter showing\nthat it is the common species which afford the greatest number of recorded\nvarieties or incipient species Hence rare species will be less quickly\nmodified or improved within any given period and they will consequently be\nbeaten in the race for life by the modified descendants of the commoner\nspecies\n\nFrom these several considerations I think it inevitably follows that as\nnew species in the course of time are formed through natural selection\nothers will become rarer and rarer and finally extinct The forms which\nstand in closest competition with those undergoing modification and\nimprovement will naturally suffer most And we have seen in the chapter on\nthe Struggle for Existence that it is the most closelyallied\nformsvarieties of the same species and species of the same genus or of\nrelated generawhich from having nearly the same structure\nconstitution and habits generally come into the severest competition with\neach other Consequently each new variety or species during the progress\nof its formation will generally press hardest on its nearest kindred and\ntend to exterminate them We see the same process of extermination amongst\nour domesticated productions through the selection of improved forms by\nman Many curious 111 instances could be given showing how quickly new\nbreeds of cattle sheep and other animals and varieties of flowers take\nthe place of older and inferior kinds In Yorkshire it is historically\nknown that the ancient black cattle were displaced by the longhorns and\nthat these were swept away by the shorthorns I quote the words of an\nagricultural writer as if by some murderous pestilence\n\n\n\nDivergence of CharacterThe principle which I have designated by this\nterm is of high importance on my theory and explains as I believe\nseveral important facts In the first place varieties even\nstronglymarked ones though having somewhat of the character of\nspeciesas is shown by the hopeless doubts in many cases how to rank\nthemyet certainly differ from each other far less than do good and\ndistinct species Nevertheless according to my view varieties are species\nin the process of formation or are as I have called them incipient\nspecies How then does the lesser difference between varieties become\naugmented into the greater difference between species That this does\nhabitually happen we must infer from most of the innumerable species\nthroughout nature presenting wellmarked differences whereas varieties\nthe supposed prototypes and parents of future wellmarked species present\nslight and illdefined differences Mere chance as we may call it might\ncause one variety to differ in some character from its parents and the\noffspring of this variety again to differ from its parent in the very same\ncharacter and in a greater degree but this alone would never account for\nso habitual and large an amount of difference as that between varieties of\nthe same species and species of the same genus\n\nAs has always been my practice let us seek light on 112 this head from\nour domestic productions We shall here find something analogous A fancier\nis struck by a pigeon having a slightly shorter beak another fancier is\nstruck by a pigeon having a rather longer beak and on the acknowledged\nprinciple that fanciers do not and will not admire a medium standard but\nlike extremes they both go on as has actually occurred with\ntumblerpigeons choosing and breeding from birds with longer and longer\nbeaks or with shorter and shorter beaks Again we may suppose that at an\nearly period one man preferred swifter horses another stronger and more\nbulky horses The early differences would be very slight in the course of\ntime from the continued selection of swifter horses by some breeders and\nof stronger ones by others the differences would become greater and would\nbe noted as forming two subbreeds finally after the lapse of centuries\nthe subbreeds would become converted into two wellestablished and\ndistinct breeds As the differences slowly become greater the inferior\nanimals with intermediate characters being neither very swift nor very\nstrong will have been neglected and will have tended to disappear Here\nthen we see in mans productions the action of what may be called the\nprinciple of divergence causing differences at first barely appreciable\nsteadily to increase and the breeds to diverge in character both from each\nother and from their common parent\n\nBut how it may be asked can any analogous principle apply in nature I\nbelieve it can and does apply most efficiently from the simple\ncircumstance that the more diversified the descendants from any one species\nbecome in structure constitution and habits by so much will they be\nbetter enabled to seize on many and widely diversified places in the polity\nof nature and so be enabled to increase in numbers 113\n\nWe can clearly see this in the case of animals with simple habits Take the\ncase of a carnivorous quadruped of which the number that can be supported\nin any country has long ago arrived at its full average If its natural\npowers of increase be allowed to act it can succeed in increasing the\ncountry not undergoing any change in its conditions only by its varying\ndescendants seizing on places at present occupied by other animals: some of\nthem for instance being enabled to feed on new kinds of prey either dead\nor alive some inhabiting new stations climbing trees frequenting water\nand some perhaps becoming less carnivorous The more diversified in habits\nand structure the descendants of our carnivorous animal became the more\nplaces they would be enabled to occupy What applies to one animal will\napply throughout all time to all animalsthat is if they varyfor\notherwise natural selection can do nothing So it will be with plants It\nhas been experimentally proved that if a plot of ground be sown with one\nspecies of grass and a similar plot be sown with several distinct genera\nof grasses a greater number of plants and a greater weight of dry herbage\ncan thus be raised The same has been found to hold good when first one\nvariety and then several mixed varieties of wheat have been sown on equal\nspaces of ground Hence if any one species of grass were to go on varying\nand those varieties were continually selected which differed from each\nother in at all the same manner as distinct species and genera of grasses\ndiffer from each other a greater number of individual plants of this\nspecies of grass including its modified descendants would succeed in\nliving on the same piece of ground And we well know that each species and\neach variety of grass is annually sowing almost countless seeds and thus\nas it may be said is striving its utmost to increase its numbers 114\nConsequently I cannot doubt that in the course of many thousands of\ngenerations the most distinct varieties of any one species of grass would\nalways have the best chance of succeeding and of increasing in numbers and\nthus of supplanting the less distinct varieties and varieties when\nrendered very distinct from each other take the rank of species\n\nThe truth of the principle that the greatest amount of life can be\nsupported by great diversification of structure is seen under many natural\ncircumstances In an extremely small area especially if freely open to\nimmigration and where the contest between individual and individual must\nbe severe we always find great diversity in its inhabitants For instance\nI found that a piece of turf three feet by four in size which had been\nexposed for many years to exactly the same conditions supported twenty\nspecies of plants and these belonged to eighteen genera and to eight\norders which shows how much these plants differed from each other So it\nis with the plants and insects on small and uniform islets and so in small\nponds of fresh water Farmers find that they can raise most food by a\nrotation of plants belonging to the most different orders: nature follows\nwhat may be called a simultaneous rotation Most of the animals and plants\nwhich live close round any small piece of ground could live on it\nsupposing it not to be in any way peculiar in its nature and may be said\nto be striving to the utmost to live there but it is seen that where\nthey come into the closest competition with each other the advantages of\ndiversification of structure with the accompanying differences of habit\nand constitution determine that the inhabitants which thus jostle each\nother most closely shall as a general rule belong to what we call\ndifferent genera and orders\n\nThe same principle is seen in the naturalisation of 115 plants through\nmans agency in foreign lands It might have been expected that the plants\nwhich have succeeded in becoming naturalised in any land would generally\nhave been closely allied to the indigenes for these are commonly looked at\nas specially created and adapted for their own country It might also\nperhaps have been expected that naturalised plants would have belonged to a\nfew groups more especially adapted to certain stations in their new homes\nBut the case is very different and Alph De Candolle has well remarked in\nhis great and admirable work that floras gain by naturalisation\nproportionally with the number of the native genera and species far more\nin new genera than in new species To give a single instance: in the last\nedition of Dr Asa Grays Manual of the Flora of the Northern United\nStates 260 naturalised plants are enumerated and these belong to 162\ngenera We thus see that these naturalised plants are of a highly\ndiversified nature They differ moreover to a large extent from the\nindigenes for out of the 162 genera no less than 100 genera are not there\nindigenous and thus a large proportional addition is made to the genera of\nthese States\n\nBy considering the nature of the plants or animals which have struggled\nsuccessfully with the indigenes of any country and have there become\nnaturalised we may gain some crude idea in what manner some of the natives\nwould have to be modified in order to gain an advantage over the other\nnatives and we may at least safely infer that diversification of\nstructure amounting to new generic differences would be profitable to\nthem\n\nThe advantage of diversification in the inhabitants of the same region is\nin fact the same as that of the physiological division of labour in the\norgans of the same individual bodya subject so well elucidated by Milne\n116 Edwards No physiologist doubts that a stomach adapted to digest\nvegetable matter alone or flesh alone draws most nutriment from these\nsubstances So in the general economy of any land the more widely and\nperfectly the animals and plants are diversified for different habits of\nlife so will a greater number of individuals be capable of there\nsupporting themselves A set of animals with their organisation but little\ndiversified could hardly compete with a set more perfectly diversified in\nstructure It may be doubted for instance whether the Australian\nmarsupials which are divided into groups differing but little from each\nother and feebly representing as Mr Waterhouse and others have remarked\nour carnivorous ruminant and rodent mammals could successfully compete\nwith these wellpronounced orders In the Australian mammals we see the\nprocess of diversification in an early and incomplete stage of development\n\nAfter the foregoing discussion which ought to have been much amplified we\nmay I think assume that the modified descendants of any one species will\nsucceed by so much the better as they become more diversified in structure\nand are thus enabled to encroach on places occupied by other beings Now\nlet us see how this principle of benefit being derived from divergence of\ncharacter combined with the principles of natural selection and of\nextinction will tend to act\n\nThe accompanying diagram will aid us in understanding this rather\nperplexing subject Let A to L represent the species of a genus large in\nits own country these species are supposed to resemble each other in\nunequal degrees as is so generally the case in nature and as is\nrepresented in the diagram by the letters standing at unequal distances I\nhave said a large genus because we have seen in the second chapter 117\nthat on an average more of the species of large genera vary than of small\ngenera and the varying species of the large genera present a greater\nnumber of varieties We have also seen that the species which are the\ncommonest and the most widelydiffused vary more than rare species with\nrestricted ranges Let A be a common widelydiffused and varying\nspecies belonging to a genus large in its own country The little fan of\ndiverging dotted lines of unequal lengths proceeding from A may\nrepresent its varying offspring The variations are supposed to be\nextremely slight but of the most diversified nature they are not supposed\nall to appear simultaneously but often after long intervals of time nor\nare they all supposed to endure for equal periods Only those variations\nwhich are in some way profitable will be preserved or naturally selected\nAnd here the importance of the principle of benefit being derived from\ndivergence of character comes in for this will generally lead to the most\ndifferent or divergent variations represented by the outer dotted lines\nbeing preserved and accumulated by natural selection When a dotted line\nreaches one of the horizontal lines and is there marked by a small\nnumbered letter a sufficient amount of variation is supposed to have been\naccumulated to have formed a fairly wellmarked variety such as would be\nthought worthy of record in a systematic work\n\nIllustration\n\nThe intervals between the horizontal lines in the diagram may represent\neach a thousand generations but it would have been better if each had\nrepresented ten thousand generations After a thousand generations species\nA is supposed to have produced two fairly wellmarked varieties namely\na1 and m1 These two varieties will generally continue to be exposed to\nthe same conditions which made their parents variable 118 and the\ntendency to variability is in itself hereditary consequently they will\ntend to vary and generally to vary in nearly the same manner as their\nparents varied Moreover these two varieties being only slightly modified\nforms will tend to inherit those advantages which made their parent A\nmore numerous than most of the other inhabitants of the same country they\nwill likewise partake of those more general advantages which made the genus\nto which the parentspecies belonged a large genus in its own country And\nthese circumstances we know to be favourable to the production of new\nvarieties\n\nIf then these two varieties be variable the most divergent of their\nvariations will generally be preserved during the next thousand\ngenerations And after this interval variety a1 is supposed in the\ndiagram to have produced variety a2 which will owing to the principle of\ndivergence differ more from A than did variety a1 Variety m1 is\nsupposed to have produced two varieties namely m2 and s2 differing from\neach other and more considerably from their common parent A We may\ncontinue the process by similar steps for any length of time some of the\nvarieties after each thousand generations producing only a single\nvariety but in a more and more modified condition some producing two or\nthree varieties and some failing to produce any Thus the varieties or\nmodified descendants proceeding from the common parent A will generally\ngo on increasing in number and diverging in character In the diagram the\nprocess is represented up to the tenthousandth generation and under a\ncondensed and simplified form up to the fourteenthousandth generation\n\nBut I must here remark that I do not suppose that the process ever goes on\nso regularly as is represented in the diagram though in itself made\nsomewhat irregular 119 I am far from thinking that the most divergent\nvarieties will invariably prevail and multiply: a medium form may often\nlong endure and may or may not produce more than one modified descendant\nfor natural selection will always act according to the nature of the places\nwhich are either unoccupied or not perfectly occupied by other beings and\nthis will depend on infinitely complex relations But as a general rule\nthe more diversified in structure the descendants from any one species can\nbe rendered the more places they will be enabled to seize on and the more\ntheir modified progeny will be increased In our diagram the line of\nsuccession is broken at regular intervals by small numbered letters marking\nthe successive forms which have become sufficiently distinct to be recorded\nas varieties But these breaks are imaginary and might have been inserted\nanywhere after intervals long enough to have allowed the accumulation of a\nconsiderable amount of divergent variation\n\nAs all the modified descendants from a common and widelydiffused species\nbelonging to a large genus will tend to partake of the same advantages\nwhich made their parent successful in life they will generally go on\nmultiplying in number as well as diverging in character: this is\nrepresented in the diagram by the several divergent branches proceeding\nfrom A The modified offspring from the later and more highly improved\nbranches in the lines of descent will it is probable often take the\nplace of and so destroy the earlier and less improved branches: this is\nrepresented in the diagram by some of the lower branches not reaching to\nthe upper horizontal lines In some cases I do not doubt that the process\nof modification will be confined to a single line of descent and the\nnumber of the descendants will not be increased although the amount 120\nof divergent modification may have been increased in the successive\ngenerations This case would be represented in the diagram if all the\nlines proceeding from A were removed excepting that from a1 to a10\nIn the same way for instance the English racehorse and English pointer\nhave apparently both gone on slowly diverging in character from their\noriginal stocks without either having given off any fresh branches or\nraces\n\nAfter ten thousand generations species A is supposed to have produced\nthree forms a10 f10 and m10 which from having diverged in\ncharacter during the successive generations will have come to differ\nlargely but perhaps unequally from each other and from their common\nparent If we suppose the amount of change between each horizontal line in\nour diagram to be excessively small these three forms may still be only\nwellmarked varieties or they may have arrived at the doubtful category of\nsubspecies but we have only to suppose the steps in the process of\nmodification to be more numerous or greater in amount to convert these\nthree forms into welldefined species: thus the diagram illustrates the\nsteps by which the small differences distinguishing varieties are increased\ninto the larger differences distinguishing species By continuing the same\nprocess for a greater number of generations as shown in the diagram in a\ncondensed and simplified manner we get eight species marked by the\nletters between a14 and m14 all descended from A Thus as I\nbelieve species are multiplied and genera are formed\n\nIn a large genus it is probable that more than one species would vary In\nthe diagram I have assumed that a second species I has produced by\nanalogous steps after ten thousand generations either two wellmarked\nvarieties w10 and z10 or two species according to the amount of\nchange supposed to be represented 121 between the horizontal lines After\nfourteen thousand generations six new species marked by the letters\nn14 to z14 are supposed to have been produced In each genus the\nspecies which are already extremely different in character will generally\ntend to produce the greatest number of modified descendants for these will\nhave the best chance of filling new and widely different places in the\npolity of nature: hence in the diagram I have chosen the extreme species\nA and the nearly extreme species I as those which have largely\nvaried and have given rise to new varieties and species The other nine\nspecies marked by capital letters of our original genus may for a long\nperiod continue to transmit unaltered descendants and this is shown in the\ndiagram by the dotted lines not prolonged far upwards from want of space\n\nBut during the process of modification represented in the diagram another\nof our principles namely that of extinction will have played an important\npart As in each fully stocked country natural selection necessarily acts\nby the selected form having some advantage in the struggle for life over\nother forms there will be a constant tendency in the improved descendants\nof any one species to supplant and exterminate in each stage of descent\ntheir predecessors and their original parent For it should be remembered\nthat the competition will generally be most severe between those forms\nwhich are most nearly related to each other in habits constitution and\nstructure Hence all the intermediate forms between the earlier and later\nstates that is between the less and more improved state of a species as\nwell as the original parentspecies itself will generally tend to become\nextinct So it probably will be with many whole collateral lines of\ndescent which will be conquered by later and improved lines of descent\nIf however the 122 modified offspring of a species get into some\ndistinct country or become quickly adapted to some quite new station in\nwhich child and parent do not come into competition both may continue to\nexist\n\nIf then our diagram be assumed to represent a considerable amount of\nmodification species A and all the earlier varieties will have become\nextinct having been replaced by eight new species a14 to m14 and\nI will have been replaced by six n14 to z14 new species\n\nBut we may go further than this The original species of our genus were\nsupposed to resemble each other in unequal degrees as is so generally the\ncase in nature species A being more nearly related to B C and D than\nto the other species and species I more to G H K L than to the\nothers These two species A and I were also supposed to be very common\nand widely diffused species so that they must originally have had some\nadvantage over most of the other species of the genus Their modified\ndescendants fourteen in number at the fourteenthousandth generation will\nprobably have inherited some of the same advantages: they have also been\nmodified and improved in a diversified manner at each stage of descent so\nas to have become adapted to many related places in the natural economy of\ntheir country It seems therefore to me extremely probable that they will\nhave taken the places of and thus exterminated not only their parents A\nand I but likewise some of the original species which were most nearly\nrelated to their parents Hence very few of the original species will have\ntransmitted offspring to the fourteenthousandth generation We may suppose\nthat only one F of the two species which were least closely related to\nthe other nine original species has transmitted descendants to this late\nstage of descent 123\n\nThe new species in our diagram descended from the original eleven species\nwill now be fifteen in number Owing to the divergent tendency of natural\nselection the extreme amount of difference in character between species\na14 and z14 will be much greater than that between the most different\nof the original eleven species The new species moreover will be allied\nto each other in a widely different manner Of the eight descendants from\nA the three marked a14 q14 p14 will be nearly related from\nhaving recently branched off from a10 b14 and f14 from having\ndiverged at an earlier period from a5 will be in some degree distinct\nfrom the three firstnamed species and lastly o14 e14 and m14\nwill be nearly related one to the other but from having diverged at the\nfirst commencement of the process of modification will be widely different\nfrom the other five species and may constitute a subgenus or even a\ndistinct genus\n\nThe six descendants from I will form two subgenera or even genera But\nas the original species I differed largely from A standing nearly at\nthe extreme points of the original genus the six descendants from I\nwill owing to inheritance alone differ considerably from the eight\ndescendants from A the two groups moreover are supposed to have gone\non diverging in different directions The intermediate species also and\nthis is a very important consideration which connected the original\nspecies A and I have all become excepting F extinct and have left\nno descendants Hence the six new species descended from I and the eight\ndescended from A will have to be ranked as very distinct genera or even\nas distinct subfamilies\n\nThus it is as I believe that two or more genera are produced by descent\nwith modification from two or more species of the same genus And the two\nor 124 more parentspecies are supposed to have descended from some one\nspecies of an earlier genus In our diagram this is indicated by the\nbroken lines beneath the capital letters converging in subbranches\ndownwards towards a single point this point representing a single species\nthe supposed single parent of our several new subgenera and genera\n\nIt is worth while to reflect for a moment on the character of the new\nspecies F14 which is supposed not to have diverged much in character\nbut to have retained the form of F either unaltered or altered only in a\nslight degree In this case its affinities to the other fourteen new\nspecies will be of a curious and circuitous nature Having descended from a\nform which stood between the two parentspecies A and I now supposed\nto be extinct and unknown it will be in some degree intermediate in\ncharacter between the two groups descended from these species But as these\ntwo groups have gone on diverging in character from the type of their\nparents the new species F14 will not be directly intermediate between\nthem but rather between types of the two groups and every naturalist will\nbe able to bring some such case before his mind\n\nIn the diagram each horizontal line has hitherto been supposed to\nrepresent a thousand generations but each may represent a million or\nhundred million generations and likewise a section of the successive\nstrata of the earths crust including extinct remains We shall when we\ncome to our chapter on Geology have to refer again to this subject and I\nthink we shall then see that the diagram throws light on the affinities of\nextinct beings which though generally belonging to the same orders or\nfamilies or genera with those now living yet are often in some degree\nintermediate in character between existing groups and we can understand\nthis fact for 125 the extinct species lived at very ancient epochs when\nthe branching lines of descent had diverged less\n\nI see no reason to limit the process of modification as now explained to\nthe formation of genera alone If in our diagram we suppose the amount of\nchange represented by each successive group of diverging dotted lines to be\nvery great the forms marked a14 to p14 those marked b14 and\nf14 and those marked o14 to m14 will form three very distinct\ngenera We shall also have two very distinct genera descended from I and\nas these latter two genera both from continued divergence of character and\nfrom inheritance from a different parent will differ widely from the three\ngenera descended from A the two little groups of genera will form two\ndistinct families or even orders according to the amount of divergent\nmodification supposed to be represented in the diagram And the two new\nfamilies or orders will have descended from two species of the original\ngenus and these two species are supposed to have descended from one\nspecies of a still more ancient and unknown genus\n\nWe have seen that in each country it is the species of the larger genera\nwhich oftenest present varieties or incipient species This indeed might\nhave been expected for as natural selection acts through one form having\nsome advantage over other forms in the struggle for existence it will\nchiefly act on those which already have some advantage and the largeness\nof any group shows that its species have inherited from a common ancestor\nsome advantage in common Hence the struggle for the production of new and\nmodified descendants will mainly lie between the larger groups which are\nall trying to increase in number One large group will slowly conquer\nanother large group reduce its numbers and thus lessen its chance of\nfurther variation and improvement Within the same large 126 group the\nlater and more highly perfected subgroups from branching out and seizing\non many new places in the polity of Nature will constantly tend to\nsupplant and destroy the earlier and less improved subgroups Small and\nbroken groups and subgroups will finally disappear Looking to the future\nwe can predict that the groups of organic beings which are now large and\ntriumphant and which are least broken up that is which as yet have\nsuffered least extinction will for a long period continue to increase But\nwhich groups will ultimately prevail no man can predict for we well know\nthat many groups formerly most extensively developed have now become\nextinct Looking still more remotely to the future we may predict that\nowing to the continued and steady increase of the larger groups a\nmultitude of smaller groups will become utterly extinct and leave no\nmodified descendants and consequently that of the species living at any\none period extremely few will transmit descendants to a remote futurity I\nshall have to return to this subject in the chapter on Classification but\nI may add that on this view of extremely few of the more ancient species\nhaving transmitted descendants and on the view of all the descendants of\nthe same species making a class we can understand how it is that there\nexist but very few classes in each main division of the animal and\nvegetable kingdoms Although extremely few of the most ancient species may\nnow have living and modified descendants yet at the most remote geological\nperiod the earth may have been as well peopled with many species of many\ngenera families orders and classes as at the present day\n\n\n\nSummary of ChapterIf during the long course of ages and under varying\nconditions of life organic beings 127 vary at all in the several parts\nof their organisation and I think this cannot be disputed if there be\nowing to the high geometrical ratio of increase of each species a severe\nstruggle for life at some age season or year and this certainly cannot\nbe disputed then considering the infinite complexity of the relations of\nall organic beings to each other and to their conditions of existence\ncausing an infinite diversity in structure constitution and habits to be\nadvantageous to them I think it would be a most extraordinary fact if no\nvariation ever had occurred useful to each beings own welfare in the same\nmanner as so many variations have occurred useful to man But if variations\nuseful to any organic being do occur assuredly individuals thus\ncharacterised will have the best chance of being preserved in the struggle\nfor life and from the strong principle of inheritance they will tend to\nproduce offspring similarly characterised This principle of preservation\nI have called for the sake of brevity Natural Selection and it leads to\nthe improvement of each creature in relation to its organic and inorganic\nconditions of life\n\nNatural selection on the principle of qualities being inherited at\ncorresponding ages can modify the egg seed or young as easily as the\nadult Amongst many animals sexual selection will give its aid to ordinary\nselection by assuring to the most vigorous and best adapted males the\ngreatest number of offspring Sexual selection will also give characters\nuseful to the males alone in their struggles with other males\n\nWhether natural selection has really thus acted in nature in modifying and\nadapting the various forms of life to their several conditions and\nstations must be judged of by the general tenour and balance of evidence\ngiven in the following chapters But we already see how it entails\nextinction and how largely extinction 128 has acted in the worlds\nhistory geology plainly declares Natural selection also leads to\ndivergence of character for more living beings can be supported on the\nsame area the more they diverge in structure habits and constitution of\nwhich we see proof by looking to the inhabitants of any small spot or to\nnaturalised productions Therefore during the modification of the\ndescendants of any one species and during the incessant struggle of all\nspecies to increase in numbers the more diversified these descendants\nbecome the better will be their chance of succeeding in the battle for\nlife Thus the small differences distinguishing varieties of the same\nspecies steadily tend to increase till they come to equal the greater\ndifferences between species of the same genus or even of distinct genera\n\nWe have seen that it is the common the widelydiffused and widelyranging\nspecies belonging to the larger genera which vary most and these tend to\ntransmit to their modified offspring that superiority which now makes them\ndominant in their own countries Natural selection as has just been\nremarked leads to divergence of character and to much extinction of the\nless improved and intermediate forms of life On these principles I\nbelieve the nature of the affinities of all organic beings may be\nexplained It is a truly wonderful factthe wonder of which we are apt to\noverlook from familiaritythat all animals and all plants throughout all\ntime and space should be related to each other in group subordinate to\ngroup in the manner which we everywhere beholdnamely varieties of the\nsame species most closely related together species of the same genus less\nclosely and unequally related together forming sections and subgenera\nspecies of distinct genera much less closely related and genera related in\ndifferent degrees forming 129 subfamilies families orders\nsubclasses and classes The several subordinate groups in any class\ncannot be ranked in a single file but seem rather to be clustered round\npoints and these round other points and so on in almost endless cycles\nOn the view that each species has been independently created I can see no\nexplanation of this great fact in the classification of all organic beings\nbut to the best of my judgment it is explained through inheritance and\nthe complex action of natural selection entailing extinction and\ndivergence of character as we have seen illustrated in the diagram\n\nThe affinities of all the beings of the same class have sometimes been\nrepresented by a great tree I believe this simile largely speaks the\ntruth The green and budding twigs may represent existing species and\nthose produced during each former year may represent the long succession of\nextinct species At each period of growth all the growing twigs have tried\nto branch out on all sides and to overtop and kill the surrounding twigs\nand branches in the same manner as species and groups of species have\ntried to overmaster other species in the great battle for life The limbs\ndivided into great branches and these into lesser and lesser branches\nwere themselves once when the tree was small budding twigs and this\nconnexion of the former and present buds by ramifying branches may well\nrepresent the classification of all extinct and living species in groups\nsubordinate to groups Of the many twigs which flourished when the tree was\na mere bush only two or three now grown into great branches yet survive\nand bear all the other branches so with the species which lived during\nlongpast geological periods very few now have living and modified\ndescendants From the first growth of the tree many a limb and branch has\ndecayed and dropped off and these lost branches of various 130 sizes may\nrepresent those whole orders families and genera which have now no living\nrepresentatives and which are known to us only from having been found in a\nfossil state As we here and there see a thin straggling branch springing\nfrom a fork low down in a tree and which by some chance has been favoured\nand is still alive on its summit so we occasionally see an animal like the\nOrnithorhynchus or Lepidosiren which in some small degree connects by its\naffinities two large branches of life and which has apparently been saved\nfrom fatal competition by having inhabited a protected station As buds\ngive rise by growth to fresh buds and these if vigorous branch out and\novertop on all sides many a feebler branch so by generation I believe it\nhas been with the great Tree of Life which fills with its dead and broken\nbranches the crust of the earth and covers the surface with its ever\nbranching and beautiful ramifications\n\n                                   \n\n\n131\n\nCHAPTER

as if the variationsso common and\nmultiform in organic beings under domestication and in a lesser degree in\nthose in a state of naturehad been due to chance This of course is a\nwholly incorrect expression but it serves to acknowledge plainly our\nignorance of the cause of each particular variation Some authors believe\nit to be as much the function of the reproductive system to produce\nindividual differences or very slight deviations of structure as to make\nthe child like its parents But the much greater variability as well as\nthe greater frequency of monstrosities under domestication or cultivation\nthan under nature leads me to believe that deviations of structure are in\nsome way due to the nature of the conditions of life to which the parents\nand their more remote ancestors have been exposed during several\ngenerations I have remarked in the first chapterbut a long catalogue of\nfacts which cannot be here given would be necessary to show the truth of\nthe remarkthat the reproductive system is eminently susceptible to\nchanges in the conditions of life and to 132 this system being\nfunctionally disturbed in the parents I chiefly attribute the varying or\nplastic condition of the offspring The male and female sexual elements\nseem to be affected before that union takes place which is to form a new\nbeing In the case of sporting plants the bud which in its earliest\ncondition does not apparently differ essentially from an ovule is alone\naffected But why because the reproductive system is disturbed this or\nthat part should vary more or less we are profoundly ignorant\nNevertheless we can here and there dimly catch a faint ray of light and\nwe may feel sure that there must be some cause for each deviation of\nstructure however slight\n\nHow much direct effect difference of climate food c produces on any\nbeing is extremely doubtful My impression is that the effect is extremely\nsmall in the case of animals but perhaps rather more in that of plants We\nmay at least safely conclude that such influences cannot have produced\nthe many striking and complex coadaptations of structure between one\norganic being and another which we see everywhere throughout nature Some\nlittle influence may be attributed to climate food c: thus E Forbes\nspeaks confidently that shells at their southern limit and when living in\nshallow water are more brightly coloured than those of the same species\nfurther north or from greater depths Gould believes that birds of the same\nspecies are more brightly coloured under a clear atmosphere than when\nliving on islands or near the coast So with insects Wollaston is\nconvinced that residence near the sea affects their colours MoquinTandon\ngives a list of plants which when growing near the seashore have their\nleaves in some degree fleshy though not elsewhere fleshy Several other\nsuch cases could be given\n\nThe fact of varieties of one species when they range 133 into the zone\nof habitation of other species often acquiring in a very slight degree\nsome of the characters of such species accords with our view that species\nof all kinds are only wellmarked and permanent varieties Thus the species\nof shells which are confined to tropical and shallow seas are generally\nbrightercoloured than those confined to cold and deeper seas The birds\nwhich are confined to continents are according to Mr Gould\nbrightercoloured than those of islands The insectspecies confined to\nseacoasts as every collector knows are often brassy or lurid Plants\nwhich live exclusively on the seaside are very apt to have fleshy leaves\nHe who believes in the creation of each species will have to say that this\nshell for instance was created with bright colours for a warm sea but\nthat this other shell became brightcoloured by variation when it ranged\ninto warmer or shallower waters\n\nWhen a variation is of the slightest use to a being we cannot tell how\nmuch of it to attribute to the accumulative action of natural selection\nand how much to the conditions of life Thus it is well known to furriers\nthat animals of the same species have thicker and better fur the more\nsevere the climate is under which they have lived but who can tell how\nmuch of this difference may be due to the warmestclad individuals having\nbeen favoured and preserved during many generations and how much to the\ndirect action of the severe climate for it would appear that climate has\nsome direct action on the hair of our domestic quadrupeds\n\nInstances could be given of the same variety being produced under\nconditions of life as different as can well be conceived and on the other\nhand of different varieties being produced from the same species under the\nsame conditions Such facts show how indirectly 134 the conditions of\nlife act Again innumerable instances are known to every naturalist of\nspecies keeping true or not varying at all although living under the most\nopposite climates Such considerations as these incline me to lay very\nlittle weight on the direct action of the conditions of life Indirectly\nas already remarked they seem to play an important part in affecting the\nreproductive system and in thus inducing variability and natural\nselection will then accumulate all profitable variations however slight\nuntil they become plainly developed and appreciable by us\n\n\n\nEffects of Use and DisuseFrom the facts alluded to in the first\nchapter I think there can be little doubt that use in our domestic animals\nstrengthens and enlarges certain parts and disuse diminishes them and\nthat such modifications are inherited Under free nature we can have no\nstandard of comparison by which to judge of the effects of longcontinued\nuse or disuse for we know not the parentforms but many animals have\nstructures which can be explained by the effects of disuse As Professor\nOwen has remarked there is no greater anomaly in nature than a bird that\ncannot fly yet there are several in this state The loggerheaded duck of\nSouth America can only flap along the surface of the water and has its\nwings in nearly the same condition as the domestic Aylesbury duck As the\nlarger groundfeeding birds seldom take flight except to escape danger I\nbelieve that the nearly wingless condition of several birds which now\ninhabit or have lately inhabited several oceanic islands tenanted by no\nbeast of prey has been caused by disuse The ostrich indeed inhabits\ncontinents and is exposed to danger from which it cannot escape by flight\nbut by kicking it can defend itself from enemies as well as any of the\nsmaller 135 quadrupeds We may imagine that the early progenitor of the\nostrich had habits like those of a bustard and that as natural selection\nincreased in successive generations the size and weight of its body its\nlegs were used more and its wings less until they became incapable of\nflight\n\nKirby has remarked and I have observed the same fact that the anterior\ntarsi or feet of many male dungfeeding beetles are very often broken\noff he examined seventeen specimens in his own collection and not one had\neven a relic left In the Onites apelles the tarsi are so habitually lost\nthat the insect has been described as not having them In some other genera\nthey are present but in a rudimentary condition In the Ateuchus or sacred\nbeetle of the Egyptians they are totally deficient There is not\nsufficient evidence to induce me to believe that mutilations are ever\ninherited and I should prefer explaining the entire absence of the\nanterior tarsi in Ateuchus and their rudimentary condition in some other\ngenera by the longcontinued effects of disuse in their progenitors for\nas the tarsi are almost always lost in many dungfeeding beetles they must\nbe lost early in life and therefore cannot be much used by these insects\n\nIn some cases we might easily put down to disuse modifications of structure\nwhich are wholly or mainly due to natural selection Mr Wollaston has\ndiscovered the remarkable fact that 200 beetles out of the 550 species\ninhabiting Madeira are so far deficient in wings that they cannot fly and\nthat of the twentynine endemic genera no less than twentythree genera\nhave all their species in this condition Several facts namely that\nbeetles in many parts of the world are frequently blown to sea and perish\nthat the beetles in Madeira as observed by Mr Wollaston lie much\nconcealed 136 until the wind lulls and the sun shines that the\nproportion of wingless beetles is larger on the exposed Desertas than in\nMadeira itself and especially the extraordinary fact so strongly insisted\non by Mr Wollaston of the almost entire absence of certain large groups\nof beetles elsewhere excessively numerous and which groups have habits of\nlife almost necessitating frequent flightthese several considerations\nhave made me believe that the wingless condition of so many Madeira beetles\nis mainly due to the action of natural selection but combined probably\nwith disuse For during thousands of successive generations each individual\nbeetle which flew least either from its wings having been ever so little\nless perfectly developed or from indolent habit will have had the best\nchance of surviving from not being blown out to sea and on the other\nhand those beetles which most readily took to flight would oftenest have\nbeen blown to sea and thus have been destroyed\n\nThe insects in Madeira which are not groundfeeders and which as the\nflowerfeeding coleoptera and lepidoptera must habitually use their wings\nto gain their subsistence have as Mr Wollaston suspects their wings not\nat all reduced but even enlarged This is quite compatible with the action\nof natural selection For when a new insect first arrived on the island\nthe tendency of natural selection to enlarge or to reduce the wings would\ndepend on whether a greater number of individuals were saved by\nsuccessfully battling with the winds or by giving up the attempt and\nrarely or never flying As with mariners shipwrecked near a coast it would\nhave been better for the good swimmers if they had been able to swim still\nfurther whereas it would have been better for the bad swimmers if they had\nnot been able to swim at all and had stuck to the wreck 137\n\nThe eyes of moles and of some burrowing rodents are rudimentary in size\nand in some cases are quite covered up by skin and fur This state of the\neyes is probably due to gradual reduction from disuse but aided perhaps by\nnatural selection In South America a burrowing rodent the tucotuco or\nCtenomys is even more subterranean in its habits than the mole and I was\nassured by a Spaniard who had often caught them that they were frequently\nblind one which I kept alive was certainly in this condition the cause\nas appeared on dissection having been inflammation of the nictitating\nmembrane As frequent inflammation of the eyes must be injurious to any\nanimal and as eyes are certainly not indispensable to animals with\nsubterranean habits a reduction in their size with the adhesion of the\neyelids and growth of fur over them might in such case be an advantage\nand if so natural selection would constantly aid the effects of disuse\n\nIt is well known that several animals belonging to the most different\nclasses which inhabit the caves of Styria and of Kentucky are blind In\nsome of the crabs the footstalk for the eye remains though the eye is\ngone the stand for the telescope is there though the telescope with its\nglasses has been lost As it is difficult to imagine that eyes though\nuseless could be in any way injurious to animals living in darkness I\nattribute their loss wholly to disuse In one of the blind animals namely\nthe caverat the eyes are of immense size and Professor Silliman thought\nthat it regained after living some days in the light some slight power of\nvision In the same manner as in Madeira the wings of some of the insects\nhave been enlarged and the wings of others have been reduced by natural\nselection aided by use and disuse so in the case of the caverat natural\nselection seems to have struggled with the loss of light and 138 to have\nincreased the size of the eyes whereas with all the other inhabitants of\nthe caves disuse by itself seems to have done its work\n\nIt is difficult to imagine conditions of life more similar than deep\nlimestone caverns under a nearly similar climate so that on the common\nview of the blind animals having been separately created for the American\nand European caverns close similarity in their organisation and affinities\nmight have been expected but as Schidte and others have remarked this\nis not the case and the caveinsects of the two continents are not more\nclosely allied than might have been anticipated from the general\nresemblance of the other inhabitants of North America and Europe On my\nview we must suppose that American animals having ordinary powers of\nvision slowly migrated by successive generations from the outer world into\nthe deeper and deeper recesses of the Kentucky caves as did European\nanimals into the caves of Europe We have some evidence of this gradation\nof habit for as Schidte remarks animals not far remote from ordinary\nforms prepare the transition from light to darkness Next follow those\nthat are constructed for twilight and last of all those destined for\ntotal darkness By the time that an animal had reached after numberless\ngenerations the deepest recesses disuse will on this view have more or\nless perfectly obliterated its eyes and natural selection will often have\neffected other changes such as an increase in the length of the antenn or\npalpi as a compensation for blindness Notwithstanding such modifications\nwe might expect still to see in the caveanimals of America affinities to\nthe other inhabitants of that continent and in those of Europe to the\ninhabitants of the European continent And this is the case with some of\nthe American caveanimals as I hear from 139 Professor Dana and some of\nthe European caveinsects are very closely allied to those of the\nsurrounding country It would be most difficult to give any rational\nexplanation of the affinities of the blind caveanimals to the other\ninhabitants of the two continents on the ordinary view of their independent\ncreation That several of the inhabitants of the caves of the Old and New\nWorlds should be closely related we might expect from the wellknown\nrelationship of most of their other productions Far from feeling any\nsurprise that some of the caveanimals should be very anomalous as Agassiz\nhas remarked in regard to the blind fish the Amblyopsis and as is the\ncase with the blind Proteus with reference to the reptiles of Europe I am\nonly surprised that more wrecks of ancient life have not been preserved\nowing to the less severe competition to which the inhabitants of these dark\nabodes will probably have been exposed\n\n\n\nAcclimatisationHabit is hereditary with plants as in the period of\nflowering in the amount of rain requisite for seeds to germinate in the\ntime of sleep c and this leads me to say a few words on\nacclimatisation As it is extremely common for species of the same genus to\ninhabit very hot and very cold countries and as I believe that all the\nspecies of the same genus have descended from a single parent if this view\nbe correct acclimatisation must be readily effected during longcontinued\ndescent It is notorious that each species is adapted to the climate of its\nown home: species from an arctic or even from a temperate region cannot\nendure a tropical climate or conversely So again many succulent plants\ncannot endure a damp climate But the degree of adaptation of species to\nthe climates under which they live is often overrated 140 We may infer\nthis from our frequent inability to predict whether or not an imported\nplant will endure our climate and from the number of plants and animals\nbrought from warmer countries which here enjoy good health We have reason\nto believe that species in a state of nature are limited in their ranges by\nthe competition of other organic beings quite as much as or more than by\nadaptation to particular climates But whether or not the adaptation be\ngenerally very close we have evidence in the case of some few plants of\ntheir becoming to a certain extent naturally habituated to different\ntemperatures or becoming acclimatised: thus the pines and rhododendrons\nraised from seed collected by Dr Hooker from trees growing at different\nheights on the Himalaya were found in this country to possess different\nconstitutional powers of resisting cold Mr Thwaites informs me that he\nhas observed similar facts in Ceylon and analogous observations have been\nmade by Mr H C Watson on European species of plants brought from the\nAzores to England In regard to animals several authentic cases could be\ngiven of species within historical times having largely extended their\nrange from warmer to cooler latitudes and conversely but we do not\npositively know that these animals were strictly adapted to their native\nclimate but in all ordinary cases we assume such to be the case nor do we\nknow that they have subsequently become acclimatised to their new homes\n\nAs I believe that our domestic animals were originally chosen by\nuncivilised man because they were useful and bred readily under\nconfinement and not because they were subsequently found capable of\nfarextended transportation I think the common and extraordinary capacity\nin our domestic animals of not only withstanding the most different\nclimates but of being perfectly 141 fertile a far severer test under\nthem may be used as an argument that a large proportion of other animals\nnow in a state of nature could easily be brought to bear widely different\nclimates We must not however push the foregoing argument too far on\naccount of the probable origin of some of our domestic animals from several\nwild stocks: the blood for instance of a tropical and arctic wolf or wild\ndog may perhaps be mingled in our domestic breeds The rat and mouse cannot\nbe considered as domestic animals but they have been transported by man to\nmany parts of the world and now have a far wider range than any other\nrodent living free under the cold climate of Faroe in the north and of the\nFalklands in the south and on many islands in the torrid zones Hence I am\ninclined to look at adaptation to any special climate as a quality readily\ngrafted on an innate wide flexibility of constitution which is common to\nmost animals On this view the capacity of enduring the most different\nclimates by man himself and by his domestic animals and such facts as that\nformer species of the elephant and rhinoceros were capable of enduring a\nglacial climate whereas the living species are now all tropical or\nsubtropical in their habits ought not to be looked at as anomalies but\nmerely as examples of a very common flexibility of constitution brought\nunder peculiar circumstances into play\n\nHow much of the acclimatisation of species to any peculiar climate is due\nto mere habit and how much to the natural selection of varieties having\ndifferent innate constitutions and how much to both means combined is a\nvery obscure question That habit or custom has some influence I must\nbelieve both from analogy and from the incessant advice given in\nagricultural works even in the ancient Encyclopdias of China to be very\n142 cautious in transposing animals from one district to another for it\nis not likely that man should have succeeded in selecting so many breeds\nand subbreeds with constitutions specially fitted for their own districts:\nthe result must I think be due to habit On the other hand I can see no\nreason to doubt that natural selection will continually tend to preserve\nthose individuals which are born with constitutions best adapted to their\nnative countries In treatises on many kinds of cultivated plants certain\nvarieties are said to withstand certain climates better than others: this\nis very strikingly shown in works on fruit trees published in the United\nStates in which certain varieties are habitually recommended for the\nnorthern and others for the southern States and as most of these\nvarieties are of recent origin they cannot owe their constitutional\ndifferences to habit The case of the Jerusalem artichoke which is never\npropagated by seed and of which consequently new varieties have not been\nproduced has even been advancedfor it is now as tender as ever it\nwasas proving that acclimatisation cannot be effected The case also of\nthe kidneybean has been often cited for a similar purpose and with much\ngreater weight but until some one will sow during a score of generations\nhis kidneybeans so early that a very large proportion are destroyed by\nfrost and then collect seed from the few survivors with care to prevent\naccidental crosses and then again get seed from these seedlings with the\nsame precautions the experiment cannot be said to have been even tried\nNor let it be supposed that no differences in the constitution of seedling\nkidneybeans ever appear for an account has been published how much more\nhardy some seedlings appeared to be than others\n\nOn the whole I think we may conclude that habit 143 use and disuse\nhave in some cases played a considerable part in the modification of the\nconstitution and of the structure of various organs but that the effects\nof use and disuse have often been largely combined with and sometimes\novermastered by the natural selection of innate variations\n\n\n\nCorrelation of GrowthI mean by this expression that the whole\norganisation is so tied together during its growth and development that\nwhen slight variations in any one part occur and are accumulated through\nnatural selection other parts become modified This is a very important\nsubject most imperfectly understood The most obvious case is that\nmodifications accumulated solely for the good of the young or larva will\nit may safely be concluded affect the structure of the adult in the same\nmanner as any malconformation affecting the early embryo seriously affects\nthe whole organisation of the adult The several parts of the body which\nare homologous and which at an early embryonic period are alike seem\nliable to vary in an allied manner: we see this in the right and left sides\nof the body varying in the same manner in the front and hind legs and\neven in the jaws and limbs varying together for the lower jaw is believed\nto be homologous with the limbs These tendencies I do not doubt may be\nmastered more or less completely by natural selection: thus a family of\nstags once existed with an antler only on one side and if this had been of\nany great use to the breed it might probably have been rendered permanent\nby natural selection\n\nHomologous parts as has been remarked by some authors tend to cohere\nthis is often seen in monstrous plants and nothing is more common than the\nunion of homologous parts in normal structures as the union of 144 the\npetals of the corolla into a tube Hard parts seem to affect the form of\nadjoining soft parts it is believed by some authors that the diversity in\nthe shape of the pelvis in birds causes the remarkable diversity in the\nshape of their kidneys Others believe that the shape of the pelvis in the\nhuman mother influences by pressure the shape of the head of the child In\nsnakes according to Schlegel the shape of the body and the manner of\nswallowing determine the position of several of the most important viscera\n\nThe nature of the bond of correlation is very frequently quite obscure M\nIs Geoffroy St Hilaire has forcibly remarked that certain\nmalconformations very frequently and that others rarely coexist without\nour being able to assign any reason What can be more singular than the\nrelation between blue eyes and deafness in cats and the tortoiseshell\ncolour with the female sex the feathered feet and skin between the outer\ntoes in pigeons and the presence of more or less down on the young birds\nwhen first hatched with the future colour of their plumage or again the\nrelation between the hair and teeth in the naked Turkish dog though here\nprobably homology comes into play With respect to this latter case of\ncorrelation I think it can hardly be accidental that if we pick out the\ntwo orders of mammalia which are most abnormal in their dermal covering\nviz Cetacea whales and Edentata armadilloes scaly anteaters c\nthat these are likewise the most abnormal in their teeth\n\nI know of no case better adapted to show the importance of the laws of\ncorrelation in modifying important structures independently of utility\nand therefore of natural selection than that of the difference between\nthe outer and inner flowers in some Compositous and Umbelliferous plants\nEvery one knows the 145 difference in the ray and central florets of for\ninstance the daisy and this difference is often accompanied with the\nabortion of parts of the flower But in some Compositous plants the seeds\nalso differ in shape and sculpture and even the ovary itself with its\naccessory parts differs as has been described by Cassini These\ndifferences have been attributed by some authors to pressure and the shape\nof the seeds in the rayflorets in some Composit countenances this idea\nbut in the case of the corolla of the Umbellifer it is by no means as\nDr Hooker informs me in species with the densest heads that the inner and\nouter flowers most frequently differ It might have been thought that the\ndevelopment of the raypetals by drawing nourishment from certain other\nparts of the flower had caused their abortion but in some Composit there\nis a difference in the seeds of the outer and inner florets without any\ndifference in the corolla Possibly these several differences may be\nconnected with some difference in the flow of nutriment towards the central\nand external flowers: we know at least that in irregular flowers those\nnearest to the axis are oftenest subject to peloria and become regular I\nmay add as an instance of this and of a striking case of correlation\nthat I have recently observed in some garden pelargoniums that the central\nflower of the truss often loses the patches of darker colour in the two\nupper petals and that when this occurs the adherent nectary is quite\naborted when the colour is absent from only one of the two upper petals\nthe nectary is only much shortened\n\nWith respect to the difference in the corolla of the central and exterior\nflowers of a head or umbel I do not feel at all sure that C C Sprengels\nidea that the rayflorets serve to attract insects whose agency is highly\nadvantageous in the fertilisation of plants of 146 these two orders is\nso farfetched as it may at first appear: and if it be advantageous\nnatural selection may have come into play But in regard to the differences\nboth in the internal and external structure of the seeds which are not\nalways correlated with any differences in the flowers it seems impossible\nthat they can be in any way advantageous to the plant: yet in the\nUmbellifer these differences are of such apparent importancethe seeds\nbeing in some cases according to Tausch orthospermous in the exterior\nflowers and coelospermous in the central flowersthat the elder De\nCandolle founded his main divisions of the order on analogous differences\nHence we see that modifications of structure viewed by systematists as of\nhigh value may be wholly due to unknown laws of correlated growth and\nwithout being as far as we can see of the slightest service to the\nspecies\n\nWe may often falsely attribute to correlation of growth structures which\nare common to whole groups of species and which in truth are simply due to\ninheritance for an ancient progenitor may have acquired through natural\nselection some one modification in structure and after thousands of\ngenerations some other and independent modification and these two\nmodifications having been transmitted to a whole group of descendants with\ndiverse habits would naturally be thought to be correlated in some\nnecessary manner So again I do not doubt that some apparent\ncorrelations occurring throughout whole orders are entirely due to the\nmanner alone in which natural selection can act For instance Alph De\nCandolle has remarked that winged seeds are never found in fruits which do\nnot open: I should explain the rule by the fact that seeds could not\ngradually become winged through natural selection except in fruits which\nopened so that the individual plants producing 147 seeds which were a\nlittle better fitted to be wafted further might get an advantage over\nthose producing seed less fitted for dispersal and this process could not\npossibly go on in fruit which did not open\n\nThe elder Geoffroy and Goethe propounded at about the same period their\nlaw of compensation or balancement of growth or as Goethe expressed it\nin order to spend on one side nature is forced to economise on the other\nside I think this holds true to a certain extent with our domestic\nproductions: if nourishment flows to one part or organ in excess it rarely\nflows at least in excess to another part thus it is difficult to get a\ncow to give much milk and to fatten readily The same varieties of the\ncabbage do not yield abundant and nutritious foliage and a copious supply\nof oilbearing seeds When the seeds in our fruits become atrophied the\nfruit itself gains largely in size and quality In our poultry a large\ntuft of feathers on the head is generally accompanied by a diminished comb\nand a large beard by diminished wattles With species in a state of nature\nit can hardly be maintained that the law is of universal application but\nmany good observers more especially botanists believe in its truth I\nwill not however here give any instances for I see hardly any way of\ndistinguishing between the effects on the one hand of a part being\nlargely developed through natural selection and another and adjoining part\nbeing reduced by this same process or by disuse and on the other hand\nthe actual withdrawal of nutriment from one part owing to the excess of\ngrowth in another and adjoining part\n\nI suspect also that some of the cases of compensation which have been\nadvanced and likewise some other facts may be merged under a more general\nprinciple namely that natural selection is continually trying to\neconomise in every part of the organisation If under 148 changed\nconditions of life a structure before useful becomes less useful any\ndiminution however slight in its development will be seized on by\nnatural selection for it will profit the individual not to have its\nnutriment wasted in building up an useless structure I can thus only\nunderstand a fact with which I was much struck when examining cirripedes\nand of which many other instances could be given: namely that when a\ncirripede is parasitic within another and is thus protected it loses more\nor less completely its own shell or carapace This is the case with the\nmale Ibla and in a truly extraordinary manner with the Proteolepas: for\nthe carapace in all other cirripedes consists of the three highlyimportant\nanterior segments of the head enormously developed and furnished with\ngreat nerves and muscles but in the parasitic and protected Proteolepas\nthe whole anterior part of the head is reduced to the merest rudiment\nattached to the bases of the prehensile antenn Now the saving of a large\nand complex structure when rendered superfluous by the parasitic habits of\nthe Proteolepas though effected by slow steps would be a decided\nadvantage to each successive individual of the species for in the struggle\nfor life to which every animal is exposed each individual Proteolepas\nwould have a better chance of supporting itself by less nutriment being\nwasted in developing a structure now become useless\n\nThus as I believe natural selection will always succeed in the long run\nin reducing and saving every part of the organisation as soon as it is\nrendered superfluous without by any means causing some other part to be\nlargely developed in a corresponding degree And conversely that natural\nselection may perfectly well succeed in largely developing any organ\nwithout requiring as a necessary compensation the reduction of some\nadjoining part 149\n\nIt seems to be a rule as remarked by Is Geoffroy St Hilaire both in\nvarieties and in species that when any part or organ is repeated many\ntimes in the structure of the same individual as the vertebr in snakes\nand the stamens in polyandrous flowers the number is variable whereas the\nnumber of the same part or organ when it occurs in lesser numbers is\nconstant The same author and some botanists have further remarked that\nmultiple parts are also very liable to variation in structure Inasmuch as\nthis vegetative repetition to use Prof Owens expression seems to be a\nsign of low organisation the foregoing remark seems connected with the\nvery general opinion of naturalists that beings low in the scale of nature\nare more variable than those which are higher I presume that lowness in\nthis case means that the several parts of the organisation have been but\nlittle specialised for particular functions and as long as the same part\nhas to perform diversified work we can perhaps see why it should remain\nvariable that is why natural selection should have preserved or rejected\neach little deviation of form less carefully than when the part has to\nserve for one special purpose alone In the same way that a knife which has\nto cut all sorts of things may be of almost any shape whilst a tool for\nsome particular object had better be of some particular shape Natural\nselection it should never be forgotten can act on each part of each\nbeing solely through and for its advantage\n\nRudimentary parts it has been stated by some authors and I believe with\ntruth are apt to be highly variable We shall have to recur to the general\nsubject of rudimentary and aborted organs and I will here only add that\ntheir variability seems to be owing to their uselessness and therefore to\nnatural selection having no power to check deviations in their structure\nThus 150 rudimentary parts are left to the free play of the various laws\nof growth to the effects of longcontinued disuse and to the tendency to\nreversion\n\n\n\nA part developed in any species in an extraordinary degree or manner in\ncomparison with the same part in allied species tends to be highly\nvariableSeveral years ago I was much struck with a remark nearly to\nthe above effect published by Mr Waterhouse I infer also from an\nobservation made by Professor Owen with respect to the length of the arms\nof the ourangoutang that he has come to a nearly similar conclusion It\nis hopeless to attempt to convince any one of the truth of this proposition\nwithout giving the long array of facts which I have collected and which\ncannot possibly be here introduced I can only state my conviction that it\nis a rule of high generality I am aware of several causes of error but I\nhope that I have made due allowance for them It should be understood that\nthe rule by no means applies to any part however unusually developed\nunless it be unusually developed in comparison with the same part in\nclosely allied species Thus the bats wing is a most abnormal structure\nin the class mammalia but the rule would not here apply because there is\na whole group of bats having wings it would apply only if some one species\nof bat had its wings developed in some remarkable manner in comparison with\nthe other species of the same genus The rule applies very strongly in the\ncase of secondary sexual characters when displayed in any unusual manner\nThe term secondary sexual characters used by Hunter applies to\ncharacters which are attached to one sex but are not directly connected\nwith the act of reproduction The rule applies to males and females but as\nfemales more rarely offer remarkable secondary sexual characters it\napplies 151 more rarely to them The rule being so plainly applicable in\nthe case of secondary sexual characters may be due to the great\nvariability of these characters whether or not displayed in any unusual\nmannerof which fact I think there can be little doubt But that our rule\nis not confined to secondary sexual characters is clearly shown in the case\nof hermaphrodite cirripedes and I may here add that I particularly\nattended to Mr Waterhouses remark whilst investigating this Order and I\nam fully convinced that the rule almost invariably holds good with\ncirripedes I shall in my future work give a list of the more remarkable\ncases I will here only briefly give one as it illustrates the rule in its\nlargest application The opercular valves of sessile cirripedes rock\nbarnacles are in every sense of the word very important structures and\nthey differ extremely little even in different genera but in the several\nspecies of one genus Pyrgoma these valves present a marvellous amount of\ndiversification: the homologous valves in the different species being\nsometimes wholly unlike in shape and the amount of variation in the\nindividuals of several of the species is so great that it is no\nexaggeration to state that the varieties differ more from each other in the\ncharacters of these important valves than do other species of distinct\ngenera\n\nAs birds within the same country vary in a remarkably small degree I have\nparticularly attended to them and the rule seems to me certainly to hold\ngood in this class I cannot make out that it applies to plants and this\nwould seriously have shaken my belief in its truth had not the great\nvariability in plants made it particularly difficult to compare their\nrelative degrees of variability\n\nWhen we see any part or organ developed in a remarkable degree or manner in\nany species the fair 152 presumption is that it is of high importance to\nthat species nevertheless the part in this case is eminently liable to\nvariation Why should this be so On the view that each species has been\nindependently created with all its parts as we now see them I can see no\nexplanation But on the view that groups of species have descended from\nother species and have been modified through natural selection I think we\ncan obtain some light In our domestic animals if any part or the whole\nanimal be neglected and no selection be applied that part for instance\nthe comb in the Dorking fowl or the whole breed will cease to have a\nnearly uniform character The breed will then be said to have degenerated\nIn rudimentary organs and in those which have been but little specialised\nfor any particular purpose and perhaps in polymorphic groups we see a\nnearly parallel natural case for in such cases natural selection either\nhas not or cannot come into full play and thus the organisation is left in\na fluctuating condition But what here more especially concerns us is that\nin our domestic animals those points which at the present time are\nundergoing rapid change by continued selection are also eminently liable\nto variation Look at the breeds of the pigeon see what a prodigious\namount of difference there is in the beak of the different tumblers in the\nbeak and wattle of the different carriers in the carriage and tail of our\nfantails c these being the points now mainly attended to by English\nfanciers Even in the subbreeds as in the shortfaced tumbler it is\nnotoriously difficult to breed them nearly to perfection and frequently\nindividuals are born which depart widely from the standard There may be\ntruly said to be a constant struggle going on between on the one hand the\ntendency to reversion to a less modified state as well as an innate\ntendency to further 153 variability of all kinds and on the other hand\nthe power of steady selection to keep the breed true In the long run\nselection gains the day and we do not expect to fail so far as to breed a\nbird as coarse as a common tumbler from a good shortfaced strain But as\nlong as selection is rapidly going on there may always be expected to be\nmuch variability in the structure undergoing modification It further\ndeserves notice that these variable characters produced by mans\nselection sometimes become attached from causes quite unknown to us more\nto one sex than to the other generally to the male sex as with the wattle\nof carriers and the enlarged crop of pouters\n\nNow let us turn to nature When a part has been developed in an\nextraordinary manner in any one species compared with the other species of\nthe same genus we may conclude that this part has undergone an\nextraordinary amount of modification since the period when the species\nbranched off from the common progenitor of the genus This period will\nseldom be remote in any extreme degree as species very rarely endure for\nmore than one geological period An extraordinary amount of modification\nimplies an unusually large and longcontinued amount of variability which\nhas continually been accumulated by natural selection for the benefit of\nthe species But as the variability of the extraordinarilydeveloped part\nor organ has been so great and longcontinued within a period not\nexcessively remote we might as a general rule expect still to find more\nvariability in such parts than in other parts of the organisation which\nhave remained for a much longer period nearly constant And this I am\nconvinced is the case That the struggle between natural selection on the\none hand and the tendency to reversion and variability on the other hand\nwill in the 154 course of time cease and that the most abnormally\ndeveloped organs may be made constant I can see no reason to doubt Hence\nwhen an organ however abnormal it may be has been transmitted in\napproximately the same condition to many modified descendants as in the\ncase of the wing of the bat it must have existed according to my theory\nfor an immense period in nearly the same state and thus it comes to be no\nmore variable than any other structure It is only in those cases in which\nthe modification has been comparatively recent and extraordinarily great\nthat we ought to find the generative variability as it may be called\nstill present in a high degree For in this case the variability will\nseldom as yet have been fixed by the continued selection of the individuals\nvarying in the required manner and degree and by the continued rejection\nof those tending to revert to a former and less modified condition\n\nThe principle included in these remarks may be extended It is notorious\nthat specific characters are more variable than generic To explain by a\nsimple example what is meant If some species in a large genus of plants\nhad blue flowers and some had red the colour would be only a specific\ncharacter and no one would be surprised at one of the blue species varying\ninto red or conversely but if all the species had blue flowers the\ncolour would become a generic character and its variation would be a more\nunusual circumstance I have chosen this example because an explanation is\nnot in this case applicable which most naturalists would advance namely\nthat specific characters are more variable than generic because they are\ntaken from parts of less physiological importance than those commonly used\nfor classing genera I believe this explanation is partly yet only\nindirectly true I shall however have to 155 return to this subject in\nour chapter on Classification It would be almost superfluous to adduce\nevidence in support of the above statement that specific characters are\nmore variable than generic but I have repeatedly noticed in works on\nnatural history that when an author has remarked with surprise that some\nimportant organ or part which is generally very constant throughout\nlarge groups of species has differed considerably in closelyallied\nspecies that it has also been variable in the individuals of some of\nthe species And this fact shows that a character which is generally of\ngeneric value when it sinks in value and becomes only of specific value\noften becomes variable though its physiological importance may remain the\nsame Something of the same kind applies to monstrosities: at least Is\nGeoffroy St Hilaire seems to entertain no doubt that the more an organ\nnormally differs in the different species of the same group the more\nsubject it is to individual anomalies\n\nOn the ordinary view of each species having been independently created why\nshould that part of the structure which differs from the same part in\nother independentlycreated species of the same genus be more variable\nthan those parts which are closely alike in the several species I do not\nsee that any explanation can be given But on the view of species being\nonly strongly marked and fixed varieties we might surely expect to find\nthem still often continuing to vary in those parts of their structure which\nhave varied within a moderately recent period and which have thus come to\ndiffer Or to state the case in another manner:the points in which all\nthe species of a genus resemble each other and in which they differ from\nthe species of some other genus are called generic characters and these\ncharacters in common I attribute to 156 inheritance from a common\nprogenitor for it can rarely have happened that natural selection will\nhave modified several species fitted to more or less widelydifferent\nhabits in exactly the same manner: and as these socalled generic\ncharacters have been inherited from a remote period since that period when\nthe species first branched off from their common progenitor and\nsubsequently have not varied or come to differ in any degree or only in a\nslight degree it is not probable that they should vary at the present day\nOn the other hand the points in which species differ from other species of\nthe same genus are called specific characters and as these specific\ncharacters have varied and come to differ within the period of the\nbranching off of the species from a common progenitor it is probable that\nthey should still often be in some degree variableat least more variable\nthan those parts of the organisation which have for a very long period\nremained constant\n\nIn connexion with the present subject I will make only two other remarks\nI think it will be admitted without my entering on details that secondary\nsexual characters are very variable I think it also will be admitted that\nspecies of the same group differ from each other more widely in their\nsecondary sexual characters than in other parts of their organisation\ncompare for instance the amount of difference between the males of\ngallinaceous birds in which secondary sexual characters are strongly\ndisplayed with the amount of difference between their females and the\ntruth of this proposition will be granted The cause of the original\nvariability of secondary sexual characters is not manifest but we can see\nwhy these characters should not have been rendered as constant and uniform\nas other parts of the organisation for secondary sexual characters have\nbeen accumulated by sexual selection which 157 is less rigid in its\naction than ordinary selection as it does not entail death but only gives\nfewer offspring to the less favoured males Whatever the cause may be of\nthe variability of secondary sexual characters as they are highly\nvariable sexual selection will have had a wide scope for action and may\nthus readily have succeeded in giving to the species of the same group a\ngreater amount of difference in their sexual characters than in other\nparts of their structure\n\nIt is a remarkable fact that the secondary sexual differences between the\ntwo sexes of the same species are generally displayed in the very same\nparts of the organisation in which the different species of the same genus\ndiffer from each other Of this fact I will give in illustration two\ninstances the first which happen to stand on my list and as the\ndifferences in these cases are of a very unusual nature the relation can\nhardly be accidental The same number of joints in the tarsi is a character\ngenerally common to very large groups of beetles but in the Engid as\nWestwood has remarked the number varies greatly and the number likewise\ndiffers in the two sexes of the same species: again in fossorial\nhymenoptera the manner of neuration of the wings is a character of the\nhighest importance because common to large groups but in certain genera\nthe neuration differs in the different species and likewise in the two\nsexes of the same species This relation has a clear meaning on my view of\nthe subject: I look at all the species of the same genus as having as\ncertainly descended from the same progenitor as have the two sexes of any\none of the species Consequently whatever part of the structure of the\ncommon progenitor or of its early descendants became variable variations\nof this part would it is highly probable be taken advantage of by natural\nand sexual selection in order to fit 158 the several species to their\nseveral places in the economy of nature and likewise to fit the two sexes\nof the same species to each other or to fit the males and females to\ndifferent habits of life or the males to struggle with other males for the\npossession of the females\n\nFinally then I conclude that the greater variability of specific\ncharacters or those which distinguish species from species than of\ngeneric characters or those which the species possess in commonthat the\nfrequent extreme variability of any part which is developed in a species in\nan extraordinary manner in comparison with the same part in its congeners\nand the slight degree of variability in a part however extraordinarily it\nmay be developed if it be common to a whole group of speciesthat the\ngreat variability of secondary sexual characters and the great amount of\ndifference in these same characters between closely allied speciesthat\nsecondary sexual and ordinary specific differences are generally displayed\nin the same parts of the organisationare all principles closely\nconnected together All being mainly due to the species of the same group\nhaving descended from a common progenitor from whom they have inherited\nmuch in commonto parts which have recently and largely varied being more\nlikely still to go on varying than parts which have long been inherited and\nhave not variedto natural selection having more or less completely\naccording to the lapse of time overmastered the tendency to reversion and\nto further variabilityto sexual selection being less rigid than ordinary\nselectionand to variations in the same parts having been accumulated by\nnatural and sexual selection and having been thus adapted for secondary\nsexual and for ordinary specific purposes 159\n\n\n\nDistinct species present analogous variations and a variety of one\nspecies often assumes some of the characters of an allied species or\nreverts to some of the characters of an early progenitorThese\npropositions will be most readily understood by looking to our domestic\nraces The most distinct breeds of pigeons in countries most widely apart\npresent subvarieties with reversed feathers on the head and feathers on\nthe feetcharacters not possessed by the aboriginal rockpigeon these\nthen are analogous variations in two or more distinct races The frequent\npresence of fourteen or even sixteen tailfeathers in the pouter may be\nconsidered as a variation representing the normal structure of another\nrace the fantail I presume that no one will doubt that all such analogous\nvariations are due to the several races of the pigeon having inherited from\na common parent the same constitution and tendency to variation when acted\non by similar unknown influences In the vegetable kingdom we have a case\nof analogous variation in the enlarged stems or roots as commonly called\nof the Swedish turnip and Ruta baga plants which several botanists tank as\nvarieties produced by cultivation from a common parent: if this be not so\nthe case will then be one of analogous variation in two socalled distinct\nspecies and to these a third may be added namely the common turnip\nAccording to the ordinary view of each species having been independently\ncreated we should have to attribute this similarity in the enlarged stems\nof these three plants not to the vera causa of community of descent and\na consequent tendency to vary in a like manner but to three separate yet\nclosely related acts of creation\n\nWith pigeons however we have another case namely the occasional\nappearance in all the breeds of slatyblue birds with two black bars on\nthe wings a white 160 rump a bar at the end of the tail with the outer\nfeathers externally edged near their bases with white As all these marks\nare characteristic of the parent rockpigeon I presume that no one will\ndoubt that this is a case of reversion and not of a new yet analogous\nvariation appearing in the several breeds We may I think confidently come\nto this conclusion because as we have seen these coloured marks are\neminently liable to appear in the crossed offspring of two distinct and\ndifferently coloured breeds and in this case there is nothing in the\nexternal conditions of life to cause the reappearance of the slatyblue\nwith the several marks beyond the influence of the mere act of crossing on\nthe laws of inheritance\n\nNo doubt it is a very surprising fact that characters should reappear after\nhaving been lost for many perhaps for hundreds of generations But when a\nbreed has been crossed only once by some other breed the offspring\noccasionally show a tendency to revert in character to the foreign breed\nfor many generationssome say for a dozen or even a score of generations\nAfter twelve generations the proportion of blood to use a common\nexpression of any one ancestor is only 1 in 2048 and yet as we see it\nis generally believed that a tendency to reversion is retained by this very\nsmall proportion of foreign blood In a breed which has not been crossed\nbut in which both parents have lost some character which their progenitor\npossessed the tendency whether strong or weak to reproduce the lost\ncharacter might be as was formerly remarked for all that we can see to\nthe contrary transmitted for almost any number of generations When a\ncharacter which has been lost in a breed reappears after a great number of\ngenerations the most probable hypothesis is not that the offspring\nsuddenly takes after an ancestor some hundred generations 161 distant\nbut that in each successive generation there has been a tendency to\nreproduce the character in question which at last under unknown\nfavourable conditions gains an ascendancy For instance it is probable\nthat in each generation of the barbpigeon which produces most rarely a\nblue and blackbarred bird there has been a tendency in each generation in\nthe plumage to assume this colour This view is hypothetical but could be\nsupported by some facts and I can see no more abstract improbability in a\ntendency to produce any character being inherited for an endless number of\ngenerations than in quite useless or rudimentary organs being as we all\nknow them to be thus inherited Indeed we may sometimes observe a mere\ntendency to produce a rudiment inherited: for instance in the common\nsnapdragon Antirrhinum a rudiment of a fifth stamen so often appears\nthat this plant must have an inherited tendency to produce it\n\nAs all the species of the same genus are supposed on my theory to have\ndescended from a common parent it might be expected that they would\noccasionally vary in an analogous manner so that a variety of one species\nwould resemble in some of its characters another species this other\nspecies being on my view only a wellmarked and permanent variety But\ncharacters thus gained would probably be of an unimportant nature for the\npresence of all important characters will be governed by natural selection\nin accordance with the diverse habits of the species and will not be left\nto the mutual action of the conditions of life and of a similar inherited\nconstitution It might further be expected that the species of the same\ngenus would occasionally exhibit reversions to lost ancestral characters\nAs however we never know the exact character of the common ancestor of a\ngroup we could not distinguish these two 162 cases: if for instance we\ndid not know that the rockpigeon was not featherfooted or turncrowned\nwe could not have told whether these characters in our domestic breeds\nwere reversions or only analogous variations but we might have inferred\nthat the blueness was a case of reversion from the number of the markings\nwhich are correlated with the blue tint and which it does not appear\nprobable would all appear together from simple variation More especially\nwe might have inferred this from the blue colour and marks so often\nappearing when distinct breeds of diverse colours are crossed Hence\nthough under nature it must generally be left doubtful what cases are\nreversions to an anciently existing character and what are new but\nanalogous variations yet we ought on my theory sometimes to find the\nvarying offspring of a species assuming characters either from reversion\nor from analogous variation which already occur in some other members of\nthe same group And this undoubtedly is the case in nature\n\nA considerable part of the difficulty in recognising a variable species in\nour systematic works is due to its varieties mocking as it were some of\nthe other species of the same genus A considerable catalogue also could\nbe given of forms intermediate between two other forms which themselves\nmust be doubtfully ranked as either varieties or species and this shows\nunless all these forms be considered as independently created species that\nthe one in varying has assumed some of the characters of the other so as\nto produce the intermediate form But the best evidence is afforded by\nparts or organs of an important and uniform nature occasionally varying so\nas to acquire in some degree the character of the same part or organ in\nan allied species I have collected a long list of such cases but 163\nhere as before I lie under a great disadvantage in not being able to give\nthem I can only repeat that such cases certainly do occur and seem to me\nvery remarkable\n\nI will however give one curious and complex case not indeed as affecting\nany important character but from occurring in several species of the same\ngenus partly under domestication and partly under nature It is a case\napparently of reversion The ass not rarely has very distinct transverse\nbars on its legs like those on the legs of the zebra: it has been asserted\nthat these are plainest in the foal and from inquiries which I have made\nI believe this to be true It has also been asserted that the stripe on\neach shoulder is sometimes double The shoulderstripe is certainly very\nvariable in length and outline A white ass but not an albino has been\ndescribed without either spinal or shoulder stripe and these stripes are\nsometimes very obscure or actually quite lost in darkcoloured asses The\nkoulan of Pallas is said to have been seen with a double shoulderstripe\nThe hemionus has no shoulderstripe but traces of it as stated by Mr\nBlyth and others occasionally appear: and I have been informed by Colonel\nPoole that the foals of this species are generally striped on the legs and\nfaintly on the shoulder The quagga though so plainly barred like a zebra\nover the body is without bars on the legs but Dr Gray has figured one\nspecimen with very distinct zebralike bars on the hocks\n\nWith respect to the horse I have collected cases in England of the spinal\nstripe in horses of the most distinct breeds and of all colours\ntransverse bars on the legs are not rare in duns mouseduns and in one\ninstance in a chestnut: a faint shoulderstripe may sometimes be seen in\nduns and I have seen a trace in a 164 bay horse My son made a careful\nexamination and sketch for me of a dun Belgian carthorse with a double\nstripe on each shoulder and with legstripes and a man whom I can\nimplicitly trust has examined for me a small dun Welch pony with three\nshort parallel stripes on each shoulder\n\nIn the northwest part of India the Kattywar breed of horses is so\ngenerally striped that as I hear from Colonel Poole who examined the\nbreed for the Indian Government a horse without stripes is not considered\nas purelybred The spine is always striped the legs are generally barred\nand the shoulderstripe which is sometimes double and sometimes treble is\ncommon the side of the face moreover is sometimes striped The stripes\nare plainest in the foal and sometimes quite disappear in old horses\nColonel Poole has seen both gray and bay Kattywar horses striped when first\nfoaled I have also reason to suspect from information given me by Mr\nW W Edwards that with the English racehorse the spinal stripe is much\ncommoner in the foal than in the fullgrown animal Without here entering\non further details I may state that I have collected cases of leg and\nshoulder stripes in horses of very different breeds in various countries\nfrom Britain to Eastern China and from Norway in the north to the Malay\nArchipelago in the south In all parts of the world these stripes occur far\noftenest in duns and mouseduns by the term dun a large range of colour is\nincluded from one between brown and black to a close approach to\ncreamcolour\n\nI am aware that Colonel Hamilton Smith who has written on this subject\nbelieves that the several breeds of the horse have descended from several\naboriginal speciesone of which the dun was striped and that the\nabovedescribed appearances are all due to ancient 165 crosses with the\ndun stock But I am not at all satisfied with this theory and should be\nloth to apply it to breeds so distinct as the heavy Belgian carthorse\nWelch ponies cobs the lanky Kattywar race c inhabiting the most\ndistant parts of the world\n\nNow let us turn to the effects of crossing the several species of the\nhorsegenus Rollin asserts that the common mule from the ass and horse is\nparticularly apt to have bars on its legs: according to Mr Gosse in\ncertain parts of the United States about nine out of ten mules have striped\nlegs I once saw a mule with its legs so much striped that any one would at\nfirst have thought that it must have been the product of a zebra and Mr\nW C Martin in his excellent treatise on the horse has given a figure of\na similar mule In four coloured drawings which I have seen of hybrids\nbetween the ass and zebra the legs were much more plainly barred than the\nrest of the body and in one of them there was a double shoulderstripe In\nLord Mortons famous hybrid from a chestnut mare and male quagga the\nhybrid and even the pure offspring subsequently produced from the mare by\na black Arabian sire were much more plainly barred across the legs than is\neven the pure quagga Lastly and this is another most remarkable case a\nhybrid has been figured by Dr Gray and he informs me that he knows of a\nsecond case from the ass and the hemionus and this hybrid though the ass\nseldom has stripes on his legs and the hemionus has none and has not even a\nshoulderstripe nevertheless had all four legs barred and had three short\nshoulderstripes like those on the dun Welch pony and even had some\nzebralike stripes on the sides of its face With respect to this last\nfact I was so convinced that not even a stripe of colour appears from what\nwould commonly be called an 166 accident that I was led solely from the\noccurrence of the facestripes on this hybrid from the ass and hemionus to\nask Colonel Poole whether such facestripes ever occur in the eminently\nstriped Kattywar breed of horses and was as we have seen answered in the\naffirmative\n\nWhat now are we to say to these several facts We see several very distinct\nspecies of the horsegenus becoming by simple variation striped on the\nlegs like a zebra or striped on the shoulders like an ass In the horse we\nsee this tendency strong whenever a dun tint appearsa tint which\napproaches to that of the general colouring of the other species of the\ngenus The appearance of the stripes is not accompanied by any change of\nform or by any other new character We see this tendency to become striped\nmost strongly displayed in hybrids from between several of the most\ndistinct species Now observe the case of the several breeds of pigeons:\nthey are descended from a pigeon including two or three subspecies or\ngeographical races of a bluish colour with certain bars and other marks\nand when any breed assumes by simple variation a bluish tint these bars\nand other marks invariably reappear but without any other change of form\nor character When the oldest and truest breeds of various colours are\ncrossed we see a strong tendency for the blue tint and bars and marks to\nreappear in the mongrels I have stated that the most probable hypothesis\nto account for the reappearance of very ancient characters isthat there\nis a tendency in the young of each successive generation to produce the\nlonglost character and that this tendency from unknown causes sometimes\nprevails And we have just seen that in several species of the horsegenus\nthe stripes are either plainer or appear more commonly in the young than in\nthe old Call the breeds of pigeons some of which have bred true for 167\ncenturies species and how exactly parallel is the case with that of the\nspecies of the horsegenus For myself I venture confidently to look back\nthousands on thousands of generations and I see an animal striped like a\nzebra but perhaps otherwise very differently constructed the common\nparent of our domestic horse whether or not it be descended from one or\nmore wild stocks of the ass the hemionus quagga and zebra\n\nHe who believes that each equine species was independently created will I\npresume assert that each species has been created with a tendency to vary\nboth under nature and under domestication in this particular manner so as\noften to become striped like other species of the genus and that each has\nbeen created with a strong tendency when crossed with species inhabiting\ndistant quarters of the world to produce hybrids resembling in their\nstripes not their own parents but other species of the genus To admit\nthis view is as it seems to me to reject a real for an unreal or at\nleast for an unknown cause It makes the works of God a mere mockery and\ndeception I would almost as soon believe with the old and ignorant\ncosmogonists that fossil shells had never lived but had been created in\nstone so as to mock the shells now living on the seashore\n\n\n\nSummaryOur ignorance of the laws of variation is profound Not in one\ncase out of a hundred can we pretend to assign any reason why this or that\npart differs more or less from the same part in the parents But whenever\nwe have the means of instituting a comparison the same laws appear to have\nacted in producing the lesser differences between varieties of the same\nspecies and the greater differences between species of the same genus The\nexternal conditions of life as 168 climate and food c seem to have\ninduced some slight modifications Habit in producing constitutional\ndifferences and use in strengthening and disuse in weakening and\ndiminishing organs seem to have been more potent in their effects\nHomologous parts tend to vary in the same way and homologous parts tend to\ncohere Modifications in hard parts and in external parts sometimes affect\nsofter and internal parts When one part is largely developed perhaps it\ntends to draw nourishment from the adjoining parts and every part of the\nstructure which can be saved without detriment to the individual will be\nsaved Changes of structure at an early age will generally affect parts\nsubsequently developed and there are very many other correlations of\ngrowth the nature of which we are utterly unable to understand Multiple\nparts are variable in number and in structure perhaps arising from such\nparts not having been closely specialised to any particular function so\nthat their modifications have not been closely checked by natural\nselection It is probably from this same cause that organic beings low in\nthe scale of nature are more variable than those which have their whole\norganisation more specialised and are higher in the scale Rudimentary\norgans from being useless will be disregarded by natural selection and\nhence probably are variable Specific charactersthat is the characters\nwhich have come to differ since the several species of the same genus\nbranched off from a common parentare more variable than generic\ncharacters or those which have long been inherited and have not differed\nwithin this same period In these remarks we have referred to special parts\nor organs being still variable because they have recently varied and thus\ncome to differ but we have also seen in the second Chapter that the same\nprinciple applies to the whole individual 169 for in a district where\nmany species of any genus are foundthat is where there has been much\nformer variation and differentiation or where the manufactory of new\nspecific forms has been actively at workthere on an average we now find\nmost varieties or incipient species Secondary sexual characters are highly\nvariable and such characters differ much in the species of the same group\nVariability in the same parts of the organisation has generally been taken\nadvantage of in giving secondary sexual differences to the sexes of the\nsame species and specific differences to the several species of the same\ngenus Any part or organ developed to an extraordinary size or in an\nextraordinary manner in comparison with the same part or organ in the\nallied species must have gone through an extraordinary amount of\nmodification since the genus arose and thus we can understand why it\nshould often still be variable in a much higher degree than other parts\nfor variation is a longcontinued and slow process and natural selection\nwill in such cases not as yet have had time to overcome the tendency to\nfurther variability and to reversion to a less modified state But when a\nspecies with any extraordinarilydeveloped organ has become the parent of\nmany modified descendantswhich on my view must be a very slow process\nrequiring a long lapse of timein this case natural selection may readily\nhave succeeded in giving a fixed character to the organ in however\nextraordinary a manner it may be developed Species inheriting nearly the\nsame constitution from a common parent and exposed to similar influences\nwill naturally tend to present analogous variations and these same species\nmay occasionally revert to some of the characters of their ancient\nprogenitors Although new and important modifications may not arise from\nreversion and analogous 170 variation such modifications will add to the\nbeautiful and harmonious diversity of nature\n\nWhatever the cause may be of each slight difference in the offspring from\ntheir parentsand a cause for each must existit is the steady\naccumulation through natural selection of such differences when\nbeneficial to the individual that gives rise to all the more important\nmodifications of structure by which the innumerable beings on the face of\nthis earth are enabled to struggle with each other and the best adapted to\nsurvive\n\n                                   \n\n\n171\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nDIFFICULTIES ON

see them well defined\n\nSecondly is it possible that an animal having for instance the structure\nand habits of a bat could have been formed by the modification of some\nanimal with wholly different habits Can we believe that natural selection\ncould produce on the one hand organs of trifling importance such as the\ntail of a giraffe which serves as a flyflapper and on the other hand\norgans of

in\nseparate chapters\n\n\n\nOn the absence or rarity of transitional varietiesAs natural selection\nacts solely by the preservation of profitable modifications each new form\nwill tend in a fullystocked country to take the place of and finally to\nexterminate its own less improved parent or other lessfavoured forms with\nwhich it comes into competition Thus extinction and natural selection\nwill as we have seen go hand in hand Hence if we look at each species\nas descended from some other unknown form both the parent and all the\ntransitional varieties will generally have been exterminated by the very\nprocess of formation and perfection of the new form\n\nBut as by this theory innumerable transitional forms must have existed\nwhy do we not find them embedded in countless numbers in the crust of the\nearth It will be much more convenient to discuss this question in the\nchapter on the Imperfection of the geological record and I will here only\nstate that I believe the answer mainly lies in the record being\nincomparably less perfect than is generally supposed the imperfection of\nthe record being chiefly due to organic beings not inhabiting 173\nprofound depths of the sea and to their remains being embedded and\npreserved to a future age only in masses of sediment sufficiently thick and\nextensive to withstand an enormous amount of future degradation and such\nfossiliferous masses can be accumulated only where much sediment is\ndeposited on the shallow bed of the sea whilst it slowly subsides These\ncontingencies will concur only rarely and after enormously long intervals\nWhilst the bed of the sea is stationary or is rising or when very little\nsediment is being deposited there will be blanks in our geological\nhistory The crust of the earth is a vast museum but the natural\ncollections have been made only at intervals of time immensely remote\n\nBut it may be urged that when several closelyallied species inhabit the\nsame territory we surely ought to find at the present time many\ntransitional forms Let us take a simple case: in travelling from north to\nsouth over a continent we generally meet at successive intervals with\nclosely allied or representative species evidently filling nearly the same\nplace in the natural economy of the land These representative species\noften meet and interlock and as the one becomes rarer and rarer the other\nbecomes more and more frequent till the one replaces the other But if we\ncompare these species where they intermingle they are generally as\nabsolutely distinct from each other in every detail of structure as are\nspecimens taken from the metropolis inhabited by each By my theory these\nallied species have descended from a common parent and during the process\nof modification each has become adapted to the conditions of life of its\nown region and has supplanted and exterminated its original parent and all\nthe transitional varieties between its past and present states Hence we\nought not to expect at the 174 present time to meet with numerous\ntransitional varieties in each region though they must have existed there\nand may be embedded there in a fossil condition But in the intermediate\nregion having intermediate conditions of life why do we not now find\ncloselylinking intermediate varieties This difficulty for a long time\nquite confounded me But I think it can be in large part explained\n\nIn the first place we should be extremely cautious in inferring because an\narea is now continuous that it has been continuous during a long period\nGeology would lead us to believe that almost every continent has been\nbroken up into islands even during the later tertiary periods and in such\nislands distinct species might have been separately formed without the\npossibility of intermediate varieties existing in the intermediate zones\nBy changes in the form of the land and of climate marine areas now\ncontinuous must often have existed within recent times in a far less\ncontinuous and uniform condition than at present But I will pass over this\nway of escaping from the difficulty for I believe that many perfectly\ndefined species have been formed on strictly continuous areas though I do\nnot doubt that the formerly broken condition of areas now continuous has\nplayed an important part in the formation of new species more especially\nwith freelycrossing and wandering animals\n\nIn looking at species as they are now distributed over a wide area we\ngenerally find them tolerably numerous over a large territory then\nbecoming somewhat abruptly rarer and rarer on the confines and finally\ndisappearing Hence the neutral territory between two representative\nspecies is generally narrow in comparison with the territory proper to\neach We see the same fact in ascending mountains and sometimes 175 it\nis quite remarkable how abruptly as Alph de Candolle has observed a\ncommon alpine species disappears The same fact has been noticed by E\nForbes in sounding the depths of the sea with the dredge To those who look\nat climate and the physical conditions of life as the allimportant\nelements of distribution these facts ought to cause surprise as climate\nand height or depth graduate away insensibly But when we bear in mind that\nalmost every species even in its metropolis would increase immensely in\nnumbers were it not for other competing species that nearly all either\nprey on or serve as prey for others in short that each organic being is\neither directly or indirectly related in the most important manner to other\norganic beings we must see that the range of the inhabitants of any\ncountry by no means exclusively depends on insensibly changing physical\nconditions but in large part on the presence of other species on which it\ndepends or by which it is destroyed or with which it comes into\ncompetition and as these species are already defined objects however they\nmay have become so not blending one into another by insensible\ngradations the range of any one species depending as it does on the range\nof others will tend to be sharply defined Moreover each species on the\nconfines of its range where it exists in lessened numbers will during\nfluctuations in the number of its enemies or of its prey or in the\nseasons be extremely liable to utter extermination and thus its\ngeographical range will come to be still more sharply defined\n\nIf I am right in believing that allied or representative species when\ninhabiting a continuous area are generally so distributed that each has a\nwide range with a comparatively narrow neutral territory between them in\nwhich they become rather suddenly rarer and rarer then as varieties do\nnot essentially differ from species 176 the same rule will probably\napply to both and if we in imagination adapt a varying species to a very\nlarge area we shall have to adapt two varieties to two large areas and a\nthird variety to a narrow intermediate zone The intermediate variety\nconsequently will exist in lesser numbers from inhabiting a narrow and\nlesser area and practically as far as I can make out this rule holds\ngood with varieties in a state of nature I have met with striking\ninstances of the rule in the case of varieties intermediate between\nwellmarked varieties in the genus Balanus And it would appear from\ninformation given me by Mr Watson Dr Asa Gray and Mr Wollaston that\ngenerally when varieties intermediate between two other forms occur they\nare much rarer numerically than the forms which they connect Now if we\nmay trust these facts and inferences and therefore conclude that varieties\nlinking two other varieties together have generally existed in lesser\nnumbers than the forms which they connect then I think we can understand\nwhy intermediate varieties should not endure for very long periodswhy as\na general rule they should be exterminated and disappear sooner than the\nforms which they originally linked together\n\nFor any form existing in lesser numbers would as already remarked run a\ngreater chance of being exterminated than one existing in large numbers\nand in this particular case the intermediate form would be eminently liable\nto the inroads of closely allied forms existing on both sides of it But a\nfar more important consideration as I believe is that during the process\nof further modification by which two varieties are supposed on my theory\nto be converted and perfected into two distinct species the two which\nexist in larger numbers from inhabiting larger areas will have a great\nadvantage over the intermediate variety which exists 177 in smaller\nnumbers in a narrow and intermediate zone For forms existing in larger\nnumbers will always have a better chance within any given period of\npresenting further favourable variations for natural selection to seize on\nthan will the rarer forms which exist in lesser numbers Hence the more\ncommon forms in the race for life will tend to beat and supplant the less\ncommon forms for these will be more slowly modified and improved It is\nthe same principle which as I believe accounts for the common species in\neach country as shown in the second chapter presenting on an average a\ngreater number of wellmarked varieties than do the rarer species I may\nillustrate what I mean by supposing three varieties of sheep to be kept\none adapted to an extensive mountainous region a second to a comparatively\nnarrow hilly tract and a third to wide plains at the base and that the\ninhabitants are all trying with equal steadiness and skill to improve their\nstocks by selection the chances in this case will be strongly in favour of\nthe great holders on the mountains or on the plains improving their breeds\nmore quickly than the small holders on the intermediate narrow hilly\ntract and consequently the improved mountain or plain breed will soon take\nthe place of the less improved hill breed and thus the two breeds which\noriginally existed in greater numbers will come into close contact with\neach other without the interposition of the supplanted intermediate\nhillvariety\n\nTo sum up I believe that species come to be tolerably welldefined\nobjects and do not at any one period present an inextricable chaos of\nvarying and intermediate links: firstly because new varieties are very\nslowly formed for variation is a very slow process and natural selection\ncan do nothing until favourable 178 variations chance to occur and until\na place in the natural polity of the country can be better filled by some\nmodification of some one or more of its inhabitants And such new places\nwill depend on slow changes of climate or on the occasional immigration of\nnew inhabitants and probably in a still more important degree on some\nof the old inhabitants becoming slowly modified with the new forms thus\nproduced and the old ones acting and reacting on each other So that in\nany one region and at any one time we ought only to see a few species\npresenting slight modifications of structure in some degree permanent and\nthis assuredly we do see\n\nSecondly areas now continuous must often have existed within the recent\nperiod in isolated portions in which many forms more especially amongst\nthe classes which unite for each birth and wander much may have separately\nbeen rendered sufficiently distinct to rank as representative species In\nthis case intermediate varieties between the several representative\nspecies and their common parent must formerly have existed in each broken\nportion of the land but these links will have been supplanted and\nexterminated during the process of natural selection so that they will no\nlonger exist in a living state\n\nThirdly when two or more varieties have been formed in different portions\nof a strictly continuous area intermediate varieties will it is probable\nat first have been formed in the intermediate zones but they will\ngenerally have had a short duration For these intermediate varieties will\nfrom reasons already assigned namely from what we know of the actual\ndistribution of closely allied or representative species and likewise of\nacknowledged varieties exist in the intermediate zones in lesser numbers\nthan the varieties which they 179 tend to connect From this cause alone\nthe intermediate varieties will be liable to accidental extermination and\nduring the process of further modification through natural selection they\nwill almost certainly be beaten and supplanted by the forms which they\nconnect for these from existing in greater numbers will in the aggregate\npresent more variation and thus be further improved through natural\nselection and gain further advantages\n\nLastly looking not to any one time but to all time if my theory be true\nnumberless intermediate varieties linking most closely all the species of\nthe same group together must assuredly have existed but the very process\nof natural selection constantly tends as has been so often remarked to\nexterminate the parentforms and the intermediate links Consequently\nevidence of their former existence could be found only amongst fossil\nremains which are preserved as we shall in a future chapter attempt to\nshow in an extremely imperfect and intermittent record\n\n\n\nOn the origin and transitions of organic beings with peculiar habits and\nstructureIt has been asked by the opponents of such views as I hold\nhow for instance a land carnivorous animal could have been converted into\none with aquatic habits for how could the animal in its transitional state\nhave subsisted It would be easy to show that within the same group\ncarnivorous animals exist having every intermediate grade between truly\naquatic and strictly terrestrial habits and as each exists by a struggle\nfor life it is clear that each is well adapted in its habits to its place\nin nature Look at the Mustela vison of North America which has webbed\nfeet and which resembles an otter in its fur short legs and form of tail\nduring summer this animal 180 dives for and preys on fish but during the\nlong winter it leaves the frozen waters and preys like other polecats on\nmice and land animals If a different case had been taken and it had been\nasked how an insectivorous quadruped could possibly have been converted\ninto a flying bat the question would have been far more difficult and I\ncould have given no answer Yet I think such difficulties have very little\nweight\n\nHere as on other occasions I lie under a heavy disadvantage for out of\nthe many striking cases which I have collected I can give only one or two\ninstances of transitional habits and structures in closely allied species\nof the same genus and of diversified habits either constant or\noccasional in the same species And it seems to me that nothing less than\na long list of such cases is sufficient to lessen the difficulty in any\nparticular case like that of the bat\n\nLook at the family of squirrels here we have the finest gradation from\nanimals with their tails only slightly flattened and from others as Sir\nJ Richardson has remarked with the posterior part of their bodies rather\nwide and with the skin on their flanks rather full to the socalled flying\nsquirrels and flying squirrels have their limbs and even the base of the\ntail united by a broad expanse of skin which serves as a parachute and\nallows them to glide through the air to an astonishing distance from tree\nto tree We cannot doubt that each structure is of use to each kind of\nsquirrel in its own country by enabling it to escape birds or beasts of\nprey or to collect food more quickly or as there is reason to believe\nby lessening the danger from occasional falls But it does not follow from\nthis fact that the structure of each squirrel is the best that it is\npossible to conceive under all natural conditions Let the climate and\nvegetation change let other competing 181 rodents or new beasts of prey\nimmigrate or old ones become modified and all analogy would lead us to\nbelieve that some at least of the squirrels would decrease in numbers or\nbecome exterminated unless they also became modified and improved in\nstructure in a corresponding manner Therefore I can see no difficulty\nmore especially under changing conditions of life in the continued\npreservation of individuals with fuller and fuller flankmembranes each\nmodification being useful each being propagated until by the accumulated\neffects of this process of natural selection a perfect socalled flying\nsquirrel was produced\n\nNow look at the Galeopithecus or flying lemur which formerly was falsely\nranked amongst bats It has an extremely wide flankmembrane stretching\nfrom the corners of the jaw to the tail and including the limbs and the\nelongated fingers: the flankmembrane is also furnished with an extensor\nmuscle Although no graduated links of structure fitted for gliding\nthrough the air now connect the Galeopithecus with the other Lemurid yet\nI see no difficulty in supposing that such links formerly existed and that\neach had been formed by the same steps as in the case of the less perfectly\ngliding squirrels and that each grade of structure was useful to its\npossessor Nor can I see any insuperable difficulty in further believing it\npossible that the membraneconnected fingers and forearm of the\nGaleopithecus might be greatly lengthened by natural selection and this\nas far as the organs of flight are concerned would convert it into a bat\nIn bats which have the wingmembrane extended from the top of the shoulder\nto the tail including the hindlegs we perhaps see traces of an apparatus\noriginally constructed for gliding through the air rather than for flight\n182\n\nIf about a dozen genera of birds had become extinct or were unknown who\nwould have ventured to have surmised that birds might have existed which\nused their wings solely as flappers like the loggerheaded duck\nMicropterus of Eyton as fins in the water and front legs on the land\nlike the penguin as sails like the ostrich and functionally for no\npurpose like the Apteryx Yet the structure of each of these birds is good\nfor it under the conditions of life to which it is exposed for each has\nto live by a struggle but it is not necessarily the best possible under\nall possible conditions It must not be inferred from these remarks that\nany of the grades of wingstructure here alluded to which perhaps may all\nhave resulted from disuse indicate the natural steps by which birds have\nacquired their perfect power of flight but they serve at least to show\nwhat diversified means of transition are possible\n\nSeeing that a few members of such waterbreathing classes as the Crustacea\nand Mollusca are adapted to live on the land and seeing that we have\nflying birds and mammals flying insects of the most diversified types and\nformerly had flying reptiles it is conceivable that flyingfish which now\nglide far through the air slightly rising and turning by the aid of their\nfluttering fins might have been modified into perfectly winged animals If\nthis had been effected who would have ever imagined that in an early\ntransitional state they had been inhabitants of the open ocean and had\nused their incipient organs of flight exclusively as far as we know to\nescape being devoured by other fish\n\nWhen we see any structure highly perfected for any particular habit as the\nwings of a bird for flight we should bear in mind that animals displaying\nearly 183 transitional grades of the structure will seldom continue to\nexist to the present day for they will have been supplanted by the very\nprocess of perfection through natural selection Furthermore we may\nconclude that transitional grades between structures fitted for very\ndifferent habits of life will rarely have been developed at an early period\nin great numbers and under many subordinate forms Thus to return to our\nimaginary illustration of the flyingfish it does not seem probable that\nfishes capable of true flight would have been developed under many\nsubordinate forms for taking prey of many kinds in many ways on the land\nand in the water until their organs of flight had come to a high stage of\nperfection so as to have given them a decided advantage over other animals\nin the battle for life Hence the chance of discovering species with\ntransitional grades of structure in a fossil condition will always be less\nfrom their having existed in lesser numbers than in the case of species\nwith fully developed structures\n\nI will now give two or three instances of diversified and of changed habits\nin the individuals of the same species When either case occurs it would\nbe easy for natural selection to fit the animal by some modification of\nits structure for its changed habits or exclusively for one of its\nseveral different habits But it is difficult to tell and immaterial for\nus whether habits generally change first and structure afterwards or\nwhether slight modifications of structure lead to changed habits both\nprobably often change almost simultaneously Of cases of changed habits it\nwill suffice merely to allude to that of the many British insects which now\nfeed on exotic plants or exclusively on artificial substances Of\ndiversified habits innumerable instances could be given: I have often\nwatched a tyrant flycatcher Saurophagus sulphuratus in South America\nhovering over one spot 184 and then proceeding to another like a\nkestrel and at other times standing stationary on the margin of water and\nthen dashing like a kingfisher at a fish In our own country the larger\ntitmouse Parus major may be seen climbing branches almost like a\ncreeper it often like a shrike kills small birds by blows on the head\nand I have many times seen and heard it hammering the seeds of the yew on a\nbranch and thus breaking them like a nuthatch In North America the black\nbear was seen by Hearne swimming for hours with widely open mouth thus\ncatching almost like a whale insects in the water\n\nAs we sometimes see individuals of a species following habits widely\ndifferent from those of their own species and of the other species of the\nsame genus we might expect on my theory that such individuals would\noccasionally have given rise to new species having anomalous habits and\nwith their structure either slightly or considerably modified from that of\ntheir proper type And such instances do occur in nature Can a more\nstriking instance of adaptation be given than that of a woodpecker for\nclimbing trees and for seizing insects in the chinks of the bark Yet in\nNorth America there are woodpeckers which feed largely on fruit and others\nwith elongated wings which chase insects on the wing and on the plains of\nLa Plata where not a tree grows there is a woodpecker which in every\nessential part of its organisation even in its colouring in the harsh\ntone of its voice and undulatory flight told me plainly of its close\nbloodrelationship to our common species yet it is a woodpecker which\nnever climbs a tree\n\nPetrels are the most arial and oceanic of birds yet in the quiet Sounds\nof Tierra del Fuego the Puffinuria berardi in its general habits in its\nastonishing power of diving its manner of swimming and of flying when\n185 unwillingly it takes flight would be mistaken by any one for an auk\nor grebe nevertheless it is essentially a petrel but with many parts of\nits organisation profoundly modified On the other hand the acutest\nobserver by examining the dead body of the waterouzel would never have\nsuspected its subaquatic habits yet this anomalous member of the strictly\nterrestrial thrush family wholly subsists by divinggrasping the stones\nwith its feet and using its wings under water\n\nHe who believes that each being has been created as we now see it must\noccasionally have felt surprise when he has met with an animal having\nhabits and structure not at all in agreement What can be plainer than that\nthe webbed feet of ducks and geese are formed for swimming yet there are\nupland geese with webbed feet which rarely or never go near the water and\nno one except Audubon has seen the frigatebird which has all its four\ntoes webbed alight on the surface of the sea On the other hand grebes and\ncoots are eminently aquatic although their toes are only bordered by\nmembrane What seems plainer than that the long toes of grallatores are\nformed for walking over swamps and floating plants yet the waterhen is\nnearly as aquatic as the coot and the landrail nearly as terrestrial as\nthe quail or partridge In such cases and many others could be given\nhabits have changed without a corresponding change of structure The webbed\nfeet of the upland goose may be said to have become rudimentary in\nfunction though not in structure In the frigatebird the deeplyscooped\nmembrane between the toes shows that structure has begun to change\n\nHe who believes in separate and innumerable acts of creation will say that\nin these cases it has pleased the Creator to cause a being of one type to\ntake the place of one of another type but this seems to me only 186\nrestating the fact in dignified language He who believes in the struggle\nfor existence and in the principle of natural selection will acknowledge\nthat every organic being is constantly endeavouring to increase in numbers\nand that if any one being vary ever so little either in habits or\nstructure and thus gain an advantage over some other inhabitant of the\ncountry it will seize on the place of that inhabitant however different\nit may be from its own place Hence it will cause him no surprise that\nthere should be geese and frigatebirds with webbed feet living on the dry\nland or most rarely alighting on the water that there should be longtoed\ncorncrakes living in meadows instead of in swamps that there should be\nwoodpeckers where not a tree grows that there should be diving thrushes\nand petrels with the habits of auks\n\n\n\nOrgans of extreme perfection and complicationTo suppose that the eye\nwith all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different\ndistances for admitting different amounts of light and for the correction\nof spherical and chromatic aberration could have been formed by natural\nselection seems I freely confess absurd in the highest possible degree\nYet reason tells me that if numerous gradations from a perfect and complex\neye to one very imperfect and simple each grade being useful to its\npossessor can be shown to exist if further the eye does vary ever so\nslightly and the variations be inherited which is certainly the case and\nif any variation or modification in the organ be ever useful to an animal\nunder changing conditions of life then the difficulty of believing that a\nperfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection though\ninsuperable by our imagination can hardly be considered real How a nerve\ncomes to be sensitive to 187 light hardly concerns us more than how life\nitself first originated but I may remark that several facts make me\nsuspect that any sensitive nerve may be rendered sensitive to light and\nlikewise to those coarser vibrations of the air which produce sound\n\nIn looking for the gradations by which an organ in any species has been\nperfected we ought to look exclusively to its lineal ancestors but this\nis scarcely ever possible and we are forced in each case to look to\nspecies of the same group that is to the collateral descendants from the\nsame original parentform in order to see what gradations are possible\nand for the chance of some gradations having been transmitted from the\nearlier stages of descent in an unaltered or little altered condition\nAmongst existing Vertebrata we find but a small amount of gradation in the\nstructure of the eye and from fossil species we can learn nothing on this\nhead In this great class we should probably have to descend far beneath\nthe lowest known fossiliferous stratum to discover the earlier stages by\nwhich the eye has been perfected\n\nIn the Articulata we can commence a series with an optic nerve merely\ncoated with pigment and without any other mechanism and from this low\nstage numerous gradations of structure branching off in two fundamentally\ndifferent lines can be shown to exist until we reach a moderately high\nstage of perfection In certain crustaceans for instance there is a\ndouble cornea the inner one divided into facets within each of which\nthere is a lensshaped swelling In other crustaceans the transparent cones\nwhich are coated by pigment and which properly act only by excluding\nlateral pencils of light are convex at their upper ends and must act by\nconvergence and at their lower ends there seems to be an imperfect\nvitreous substance 188 With these facts here far too briefly and\nimperfectly given which show that there is much graduated diversity in the\neyes of living crustaceans and bearing in mind how small the number of\nliving animals is in proportion to those which have become extinct I can\nsee no very great difficulty not more than in the case of many other\nstructures in believing that natural selection has converted the simple\napparatus of an optic nerve merely coated with pigment and invested by\ntransparent membrane into an optical instrument as perfect as is possessed\nby any member of the great Articulate class\n\nHe who will go thus far if he find on finishing this treatise that large\nbodies of facts otherwise inexplicable can be explained by the theory of\ndescent ought not to hesitate to go further and to admit that a structure\neven as perfect as the eye of an eagle might be formed by natural\nselection although in this case he does not know any of the transitional\ngrades His reason ought to conquer his imagination though I have felt the\ndifficulty far too keenly to be surprised at any degree of hesitation in\nextending the principle of natural selection to such startling lengths\n\nIt is scarcely possible to avoid comparing the eye to a telescope We know\nthat this instrument has been perfected by the longcontinued efforts of\nthe highest human intellects and we naturally infer that the eye has been\nformed by a somewhat analogous process But may not this inference be\npresumptuous Have we any right to assume that the Creator works by\nintellectual powers like those of man If we must compare the eye to an\noptical instrument we ought in imagination to take a thick layer of\ntransparent tissue with a nerve sensitive to light beneath and then\nsuppose every part of this layer to be continually changing 189 slowly in\ndensity so as to separate into layers of different densities and\nthicknesses placed at different distances from each other and with the\nsurfaces of each layer slowly changing in form Further we must suppose\nthat there is a power always intently watching each slight accidental\nalteration in the transparent layers and carefully selecting each\nalteration which under varied circumstances may in any way or in any\ndegree tend to produce a distincter image We must suppose each new state\nof the instrument to be multiplied by the million and each to be preserved\ntill a better be produced and then the old ones to be destroyed In living\nbodies variation will cause the slight alterations generation will\nmultiply them almost infinitely and natural selection will pick out with\nunerring skill each improvement Let this process go on for millions on\nmillions of years and during each year on millions of individuals of many\nkinds and may we not believe that a living optical instrument might thus\nbe formed as superior to one of glass as the works of the Creator are to\nthose of man\n\nIf it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed which could not\npossibly have been formed by numerous successive slight modifications my\ntheory would absolutely break down But I can find out no such case No\ndoubt many organs exist of which we do not know the transitional grades\nmore especially if we look to muchisolated species round which according\nto my theory there has been much extinction Or again if we look to an\norgan common to all the members of a large class for in this latter case\nthe organ must have been first formed at an extremely remote period since\nwhich all the many members of the class have been developed and in order\nto discover the early transitional grades through which the organ has 190\npassed we should have to look to very ancient ancestral forms long since\nbecome extinct\n\nWe should be extremely cautious in concluding that an organ could not have\nbeen formed by transitional gradations of some kind Numerous cases could\nbe given amongst the lower animals of the same organ performing at the same\ntime wholly distinct functions thus the alimentary canal respires\ndigests and excretes in the larva of the dragonfly and in the fish\nCobites In the Hydra the animal may be turned inside out and the\nexterior surface will then digest and the stomach respire In such cases\nnatural selection might easily specialise if any advantage were thus\ngained a part or organ which had performed two functions for one\nfunction alone and thus wholly change its nature by insensible steps Two\ndistinct organs sometimes perform simultaneously the same function in the\nsame individual to give one instance there are fish with gills or\nbranchi that breathe the air dissolved in the water at the same time that\nthey breathe free air in their swimbladders this latter organ having a\nductus pneumaticus for its supply and being divided by highly vascular\npartitions In these cases one of the two organs might with ease be\nmodified and perfected so as to perform all the work by itself being aided\nduring the process of modification by the other organ and then this other\norgan might be modified for some other and quite distinct purpose or be\nquite obliterated\n\nThe illustration of the swimbladder in fishes is a good one because it\nshows us clearly the highly important fact that an organ originally\nconstructed for one purpose namely flotation may be converted into one\nfor a wholly different purpose namely respiration The swimbladder has\nalso been worked in as an accessory to the auditory organs of certain\nfish or for I do not know 191 which view is now generally held a part\nof the auditory apparatus has been worked in as a complement to the\nswimbladder All physiologists admit that the swimbladder is homologous or\nideally similar in position and structure with the lungs of the higher\nvertebrate animals: hence there seems to me to be no great difficulty in\nbelieving that natural selection has actually converted a swimbladder into\na lung or organ used exclusively for respiration\n\nI can indeed hardly doubt that all vertebrate animals having true lungs\nhave descended by ordinary generation from an ancient prototype of which\nwe know nothing furnished with a floating apparatus or swimbladder We can\nthus as I infer from Professor Owens interesting description of these\nparts understand the strange fact that every particle of food and drink\nwhich we swallow has to pass over the orifice of the trachea with some\nrisk of falling into the lungs notwithstanding the beautiful contrivance\nby which the glottis is closed In the higher Vertebrata the branchi have\nwholly disappearedthe slits on the sides of the neck and the looplike\ncourse of the arteries still marking in the embryo their former position\nBut it is conceivable that the now utterly lost branchi might have been\ngradually worked in by natural selection for some quite distinct purpose:\nin the same manner as on the view entertained by some naturalists that the\nbranchi and dorsal scales of Annelids are homologous with the wings and\nwingcovers of insects it is probable that organs which at a very ancient\nperiod served for respiration have been actually converted into organs of\nflight\n\nIn considering transitions of organs it is so important to bear in mind\nthe probability of conversion from one function to another that I will\ngive one more instance Pedunculated cirripedes have two minute folds of\nskin 192 called by me the ovigerous frena which serve through the\nmeans of a sticky secretion to retain the eggs until they are hatched\nwithin the sack These cirripedes have no branchi the whole surface of\nthe body and sack including the small frena serving for respiration The\nBalanid or sessile cirripedes on the other hand have no ovigerous frena\nthe eggs lying loose at the bottom of the sack in the wellenclosed shell\nbut they have large folded branchi Now I think no one will dispute that\nthe ovigerous frena in the one family are strictly homologous with the\nbranchi of the other family indeed they graduate into each other\nTherefore I do not doubt that little folds of skin which originally served\nas ovigerous frena but which likewise very slightly aided the act of\nrespiration have been gradually converted by natural selection into\nbranchi simply through an increase in their size and the obliteration of\ntheir adhesive glands If all pedunculated cirripedes had become extinct\nand they have already suffered far more extinction than have sessile\ncirripedes who would ever have imagined that the branchi in this latter\nfamily had originally existed as organs for preventing the ova from being\nwashed out of the sack\n\nAlthough we must be extremely cautious in concluding that any organ could\nnot possibly have been produced by successive transitional gradations yet\nundoubtedly grave cases of difficulty occur some of which will be\ndiscussed in my future work\n\nOne of the gravest is that of neuter insects which are often very\ndifferently constructed from either the males or fertile females but this\ncase will be treated of in the next chapter The electric organs of fishes\noffer another case of special difficulty it is impossible to conceive by\nwhat steps these wondrous organs have been produced but as Owen and\nothers have remarked 193 their intimate structure closely resembles that\nof common muscle and as it has lately been shown that Rays have an organ\nclosely analogous to the electric apparatus and yet do not as Matteucci\nasserts discharge any electricity we must own that we are far too\nignorant to argue that no transition of any kind is possible\n\nThe electric organs offer another and even more serious difficulty for\nthey occur in only about a dozen fishes of which several are widely remote\nin their affinities Generally when the same organ appears in several\nmembers of the same class especially if in members having very different\nhabits of life we may attribute its presence to inheritance from a common\nancestor and its absence in some of the members to its loss through disuse\nor natural selection But if the electric organs had been inherited from\none ancient progenitor thus provided we might have expected that all\nelectric fishes would have been specially related to each other Nor does\ngeology at all lead to the belief that formerly most fishes had electric\norgans which most of their modified descendants have lost The presence of\nluminous organs in a few insects belonging to different families and\norders offers a parallel case of difficulty Other cases could be given\nfor instance in plants the very curious contrivance of a mass of\npollengrains borne on a footstalk with a sticky gland at the end is the\nsame in Orchis and Asclepiasgenera almost as remote as possible amongst\nflowering plants In all these cases of two very distinct species furnished\nwith apparently the same anomalous organ it should be observed that\nalthough the general appearance and function of the organ may be the same\nyet some fundamental difference can generally be detected I am inclined to\nbelieve that in nearly the same way as two men have sometimes independently\nhit on 194 the very same invention so natural selection working for the\ngood of each being and taking advantage of analogous variations has\nsometimes modified in very nearly the same manner two parts in two organic\nbeings which beings owe but little of their structure in common to\ninheritance from the same ancestor\n\nAlthough in many cases it is most difficult to conjecture by what\ntransitions organs could have arrived at their present state yet\nconsidering that the proportion of living and known forms to the extinct\nand unknown is very small I have been astonished how rarely an organ can\nbe named towards which no transitional grade is known to lead The truth\nof this remark is indeed shown by that old but somewhat exaggerated canon\nin natural history of Natura non facit saltum We meet with this\nadmission in the writings of almost every experienced naturalist or as\nMilne Edwards has well expressed it Nature is prodigal in variety but\nniggard in innovation Why on the theory of Creation should this be so\nWhy should all the parts and organs of many independent beings each\nsupposed to have been separately created for its proper place in nature be\nso commonly linked together by graduated steps Why should not Nature have\ntaken a leap from structure to structure On the theory of natural\nselection we can clearly understand why she should not for natural\nselection can act only by taking advantage of slight successive variations\nshe can never take a leap but must advance by the shortest and slowest\nsteps\n\n\n\nOrgans of little apparent importanceAs natural selection acts by life\nand deathby the preservation of individuals with any favourable\nvariation and by the destruction of those with any unfavourable deviation\nof structureI have sometimes felt much difficulty in 195 understanding\nthe origin of simple parts of which the importance does not seem\nsufficient to cause the preservation of successively varying individuals I\nhave sometimes felt as much difficulty though of a very different kind on\nthis head as in the case of an organ as perfect and complex as the eye\n\nIn the first place we are much too ignorant in regard to the whole economy\nof any one organic being to say what slight modifications would be of\nimportance or not In a former chapter I have given instances of most\ntrifling characters such as the down on fruit and the colour of its flesh\nwhich from determining the attacks of insects or from being correlated\nwith constitutional differences might assuredly be acted on by natural\nselection The tail of the giraffe looks like an artificially constructed\nflyflapper and it seems at first incredible that this could have been\nadapted for its present purpose by successive slight modifications each\nbetter and better for so trifling an object as driving away flies yet we\nshould pause before being too positive even in this case for we know that\nthe distribution and existence of cattle and other animals in South America\nabsolutely depends on their power of resisting the attacks of insects: so\nthat individuals which could by any means defend themselves from these\nsmall enemies would be able to range into new pastures and thus gain a\ngreat advantage It is not that the larger quadrupeds are actually\ndestroyed except in some rare cases by flies but they are incessantly\nharassed and their strength reduced so that they are more subject to\ndisease or not so well enabled in a coming dearth to search for food or\nto escape from beasts of prey\n\nOrgans now of trifling importance have probably in some cases been of high\nimportance to an early progenitor and after having been slowly perfected\nat a 196 former period have been transmitted in nearly the same state\nalthough now become of very slight use and any actually injurious\ndeviations in their structure will always have been checked by natural\nselection Seeing how important an organ of locomotion the tail is in most\naquatic animals its general presence and use for many purposes in so many\nland animals which in their lungs or modified swimbladders betray their\naquatic origin may perhaps be thus accounted for A welldeveloped tail\nhaving been formed in an aquatic animal it might subsequently come to be\nworked in for all sorts of purposes as a flyflapper an organ of\nprehension or as an aid in turning as with the dog though the aid must\nbe slight for the hare with hardly any tail can double quickly enough\n\nIn the second place we may sometimes attribute importance to characters\nwhich are really of very little importance and which have originated from\nquite secondary causes independently of natural selection We should\nremember that climate food c probably have some little direct\ninfluence on the organisation that characters reappear from the law of\nreversion that correlation of growth will have had a most important\ninfluence in modifying various structures and finally that sexual\nselection will often have largely modified the external characters of\nanimals having a will to give one male an advantage in fighting with\nanother or in charming the females Moreover when a modification of\nstructure has primarily arisen from the above or other unknown causes it\nmay at first have been of no advantage to the species but may subsequently\nhave been taken advantage of by the descendants of the species under new\nconditions of life and with newly acquired habits\n\nTo give a few instances to illustrate these latter 197 remarks If green\nwoodpeckers alone had existed and we did not know that there were many\nblack and pied kinds I dare say that we should have thought that the green\ncolour was a beautiful adaptation to hide this treefrequenting bird from\nits enemies and consequently that it was a character of importance and\nmight have been acquired through natural selection as it is I have no\ndoubt that the colour is due to some quite distinct cause probably to\nsexual selection A trailing bamboo in the Malay Archipelago climbs the\nloftiest trees by the aid of exquisitely constructed hooks clustered around\nthe ends of the branches and this contrivance no doubt is of the highest\nservice to the plant but as we see nearly similar hooks on many trees\nwhich are not climbers the hooks on the bamboo may have arisen from\nunknown laws of growth and have been subsequently taken advantage of by\nthe plant undergoing further modification and becoming a climber The naked\nskin on the head of a vulture is generally looked at as a direct adaptation\nfor wallowing in putridity and so it may be or it may possibly be due to\nthe direct action of putrid matter but we should be very cautious in\ndrawing any such inference when we see that the skin on the head of the\ncleanfeeding male turkey is likewise naked The sutures in the skulls of\nyoung mammals have been advanced as a beautiful adaptation for aiding\nparturition and no doubt they facilitate or may be indispensable for this\nact but as sutures occur in the skulls of young birds and reptiles which\nhave only to escape from a broken egg we may infer that this structure has\narisen from the laws of growth and has been taken advantage of in the\nparturition of the higher animals\n\nWe are profoundly ignorant of the causes producing slight and unimportant\nvariations and we are 198 immediately made conscious of this by\nreflecting on the differences in the breeds of our domesticated animals in\ndifferent countriesmore especially in the less civilised countries where\nthere has been but little artificial selection Careful observers are\nconvinced that a damp climate affects the growth of the hair and that with\nthe hair the horns are correlated Mountain breeds always differ from\nlowland breeds and a mountainous country would probably affect the hind\nlimbs from exercising them more and possibly even the form of the pelvis\nand then by the law of homologous variation the front limbs and even the\nhead would probably be affected The shape also of the pelvis might\naffect by pressure the shape of the head of the young in the womb The\nlaborious breathing necessary in high regions would we have some reason to\nbelieve increase the size of the chest and again correlation would come\ninto play Animals kept by savages in different countries often have to\nstruggle for their own subsistence and would be exposed to a certain\nextent to natural selection and individuals with slightly different\nconstitutions would succeed best under different climates and there is\nreason to believe that constitution and colour are correlated A good\nobserver also states that in cattle susceptibility to the attacks of\nflies is correlated with colour as is the liability to be poisoned by\ncertain plants so that colour would be thus subjected to the action of\nnatural selection But we are far too ignorant to speculate on the relative\nimportance of the several known and unknown laws of variation and I have\nhere alluded to them only to show that if we are unable to account for the\ncharacteristic differences of our domestic breeds which nevertheless we\ngenerally admit to have arisen through ordinary generation we ought not to\nlay too much stress on our ignorance of the precise cause 199 of the\nslight analogous differences between species I might have adduced for this\nsame purpose the differences between the races of man which are so\nstrongly marked I may add that some little light can apparently be thrown\non the origin of these differences chiefly through sexual selection of a\nparticular kind but without here entering on copious details my reasoning\nwould appear frivolous\n\nThe foregoing remarks lead me to say a few words on the protest lately made\nby some naturalists against the utilitarian doctrine that every detail of\nstructure has been produced for the good of its possessor They believe\nthat very many structures have been created for beauty in the eyes of man\nor for mere variety This doctrine if true would be absolutely fatal to\nmy theory Yet I fully admit that many structures are of no direct use to\ntheir possessors Physical conditions probably have had some little effect\non structure quite independently of any good thus gained Correlation of\ngrowth has no doubt played a most important part and a useful modification\nof one part will often have entailed on other parts diversified changes of\nno direct use So again characters which formerly were useful or which\nformerly had arisen from correlation of growth or from other unknown\ncause may reappear from the law of reversion though now of no direct use\nThe effects of sexual selection when displayed in beauty to charm the\nfemales can be called useful only in rather a forced sense But by far the\nmost important consideration is that the chief part of the organisation of\nevery being is simply due to inheritance and consequently though each\nbeing assuredly is well fitted for its place in nature many structures now\nhave no direct relation to the habits of life of each species Thus we can\nhardly believe that the webbed feet of the upland 200 goose or of the\nfrigatebird are of special use to these birds we cannot believe that the\nsame bones in the arm of the monkey in the foreleg of the horse in the\nwing of the bat and in the nipper of the seal are of special use to these\nanimals We may safely attribute these structures to inheritance But to\nthe progenitor of the upland goose and of the frigatebird webbed feet no\ndoubt were as useful as they now are to the most aquatic of existing birds\nSo we may believe that the progenitor of the seal had not a nipper but a\nfoot with five toes fitted for walking or grasping and we may further\nventure to believe that the several bones in the limbs of the monkey\nhorse and bat which have been inherited from a common progenitor were\nformerly of more special use to that progenitor or its progenitors than\nthey now are to these animals having such widely diversified habits\nTherefore we may infer that these several bones might have been acquired\nthrough natural selection subjected formerly as now to the several laws\nof inheritance reversion correlation of growth c Hence every detail of\nstructure in every living creature making some little allowance for the\ndirect action of physical conditions may be viewed either as having been\nof special use to some ancestral form or as being now of special use to\nthe descendants of this formeither directly or indirectly through the\ncomplex laws of growth\n\nNatural selection cannot possibly produce any modification in any one\nspecies exclusively for the good of another species though throughout\nnature one species incessantly takes advantage of and profits by the\nstructure of another But natural selection can and does often produce\nstructures for the direct injury of other species as we see in the fang of\nthe adder and in the ovipositor of the ichneumon by which its eggs are\n201 deposited in the living bodies of other insects If it could be\nproved that any part of the structure of any one species had been formed\nfor the exclusive good of another species it would annihilate my theory\nfor such could not have been produced through natural selection Although\nmany statements may be found in works on natural history to this effect I\ncannot find even one which seems to me of any weight It is admitted that\nthe rattlesnake has a poisonfang for its own defence and for the\ndestruction of its prey but some authors suppose that at the same time\nthis snake is furnished with a rattle for its own injury namely to warn\nits prey to escape I would almost as soon believe that the cat curls the\nend of its tail when preparing to spring in order to warn the doomed\nmouse But I have not space here to enter on this and other such cases\n\nNatural selection will never produce in a being anything injurious to\nitself for natural selection acts solely by and for the good of each No\norgan will be formed as Paley has remarked for the purpose of causing\npain or for doing an injury to its possessor If a fair balance be struck\nbetween the good and evil caused by each part each will be found on the\nwhole advantageous After the lapse of time under changing conditions of\nlife if any part comes to be injurious it will be modified or if it be\nnot so the being will become extinct as myriads have become extinct\n\nNatural selection tends only to make each organic being as perfect as or\nslightly more perfect than the other inhabitants of the same country with\nwhich it has to struggle for existence And we see that this is the degree\nof perfection attained under nature The endemic productions of New\nZealand for instance are perfect one compared with another but they are\nnow rapidly yielding before the advancing legions of plants 202 and\nanimals introduced from Europe Natural selection will not produce absolute\nperfection nor do we always meet as far as we can judge with this high\nstandard under nature The correction for the aberration of light is said\non high authority not to be perfect even in that most perfect organ the\neye If our reason leads us to admire with enthusiasm a multitude of\ninimitable contrivances in nature this same reason tells us though we may\neasily err on both sides that some other contrivances are less perfect\nCan we consider the sting of the wasp or of the bee as perfect which when\nused against many attacking animals cannot be withdrawn owing to the\nbackward serratures and so inevitably causes the death of the insect by\ntearing out its viscera\n\nIf we look at the sting of the bee as having originally existed in a\nremote progenitor as a boring and serrated instrument like that in so many\nmembers of the same great order and which has been modified but not\nperfected for its present purpose with the poison originally adapted to\ncause galls subsequently intensified we can perhaps understand how it is\nthat the use of the sting should so often cause the insects own death: for\nif on the whole the power of stinging be useful to the community it will\nfulfil all the requirements of natural selection though it may cause the\ndeath of some few members If we admire the truly wonderful power of scent\nby which the males of many insects find their females can we admire the\nproduction for this single purpose of thousands of drones which are\nutterly useless to the community for any other end and which are\nultimately slaughtered by their industrious and sterile sisters It may be\ndifficult but we ought to admire the savage instinctive hatred of the\nqueenbee which urges her instantly to destroy the 203 young queens her\ndaughters as soon as born or to perish herself in the combat for\nundoubtedly this is for the good of the community and maternal love or\nmaternal hatred though the latter fortunately is most rare is all the\nsame to the inexorable principle of natural selection If we admire the\nseveral ingenious contrivances by which the flowers of the orchis and of\nmany other plants are fertilised through insect agency can we consider as\nequally perfect the elaboration by our firtrees of dense clouds of pollen\nin order that a few granules may be wafted by a chance breeze on to the\novules\n\n\n\nSummary of ChapterWe have in this chapter discussed some of the\ndifficulties and objections which may be urged against my theory Many of\nthem are very serious but I think that in the discussion light has been\nthrown on several facts which on the theory of independent acts of\ncreation are utterly obscure We have seen that species at any one period\nare not indefinitely variable and are not linked together by a multitude\nof intermediate gradations partly because the process of natural selection\nwill always be very slow and will act at any one time only on a very few\nforms and partly because the very process of natural selection almost\nimplies the continual supplanting and extinction of preceding and\nintermediate gradations Closely allied species now living on a continuous\narea must often have been formed when the area was not continuous and\nwhen the conditions of life did not insensibly graduate away from one part\nto another When two varieties are formed in two districts of a continuous\narea an intermediate variety will often be formed fitted for an\nintermediate zone but from reasons assigned the intermediate variety will\nusually exist in lesser numbers than 204 the two forms which it connects\nconsequently the two latter during the course of further modification\nfrom existing in greater numbers will have a great advantage over the less\nnumerous intermediate variety and will thus generally succeed in\nsupplanting and exterminating it\n\nWe have seen in this chapter how cautious we should be in concluding that\nthe most different habits of life could not graduate into each other that\na bat for instance could not have been formed by natural selection from\nan animal which at first could only glide through the air\n\nWe have seen that a species may under new conditions of life change its\nhabits or have diversified habits with some habits very unlike those of\nits nearest congeners Hence we can understand bearing in mind that each\norganic being is trying to live wherever it can live how it has arisen\nthat there are upland geese with webbed feet ground woodpeckers diving\nthrushes and petrels with the habits of auks\n\nAlthough the belief that an organ so perfect as the eye could have been\nformed by natural selection is more than enough to stagger any one yet in\nthe case of any organ if we know of a long series of gradations in\ncomplexity each good for its possessor then under changing conditions of\nlife there is no logical impossibility in the acquirement of any\nconceivable degree of perfection through natural selection In the cases in\nwhich we know of no intermediate or transitional states we should be very\ncautious in concluding that none could have existed for the homologies of\nmany organs and their intermediate states show that wonderful metamorphoses\nin function are at least possible For instance a swimbladder has\napparently been converted into an airbreathing lung The same organ having\nperformed 205 simultaneously very different functions and then having\nbeen specialised for one function and two very distinct organs having\nperformed at the same time the same function the one having been perfected\nwhilst aided by the other must often have largely facilitated transitions\n\nWe are far too ignorant in almost every case to be enabled to assert that\nany part or organ is so unimportant for the welfare of a species that\nmodifications in its structure could not have been slowly accumulated by\nmeans of natural selection But we may confidently believe that many\nmodifications wholly due to the laws of growth and at first in no way\nadvantageous to a species have been subsequently taken advantage of by the\nstill further modified descendants of this species We may also believe\nthat a part formerly of high importance has often been retained as the\ntail of an aquatic animal by its terrestrial descendants though it has\nbecome of such small importance that it could not in its present state\nhave been acquired by natural selectiona power which acts solely by the\npreservation of profitable variations in the struggle for life\n\nNatural selection will produce nothing in one species for the exclusive\ngood or injury of another though it may well produce parts organs and\nexcretions highly useful or even indispensable or highly injurious to\nanother species but in all cases at the same time useful to the owner\nNatural selection in each wellstocked country must act chiefly through\nthe competition of the inhabitants one with another and consequently will\nproduce perfection or strength in the battle for life only according to\nthe standard of that country Hence the inhabitants of one country\ngenerally the smaller one will often yield as we see they do yield to\nthe inhabitants of another and generally larger country For in 206 the\nlarger country there will have existed more individuals and more\ndiversified forms and the competition will have been severer and thus the\nstandard of perfection will have been rendered higher Natural selection\nwill not necessarily produce absolute perfection nor as far as we can\njudge by our limited faculties can absolute perfection be everywhere\nfound\n\nOn the theory of natural selection we can clearly understand the full\nmeaning of that old canon in natural history Natura non facit saltum\nThis canon if we look only to the present inhabitants of the world is not\nstrictly correct but if we include all those of past times it must by my\ntheory be strictly true\n\nIt is generally acknowledged that all organic beings have been formed on\ntwo great lawsUnity of Type and the Conditions of Existence By unity of\ntype is meant that fundamental agreement in structure which we see in\norganic beings of the same class and which is quite independent of their\nhabits of life On my theory unity of type is explained by unity of\ndescent The expression of conditions of existence so often insisted on by\nthe illustrious Cuvier is fully embraced by the principle of natural\nselection For natural selection acts by either now adapting the varying\nparts of each being to its organic and inorganic conditions of life or by\nhaving adapted them during longpast periods of time: the adaptations being\naided in some cases by use and disuse being slightly affected by the\ndirect action of the external conditions of life and being in all cases\nsubjected to the several laws of growth Hence in fact the law of the\nConditions of Existence is the higher law as it includes through the\ninheritance of former adaptations that of Unity of Type\n\n                                   \n\n\n207\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nINSTINCT\n\n    Instincts comparable with habits but different in their\n    originInstincts graduatedAphides and antsInstincts\n    variableDomestic instincts their originNatural instincts of the\n    cuckoo ostrich and parasitic beesSlavemakingantsHivebee its\n    cellmaking instinctDifficulties on the theory of the Natural\n    Selection of instinctsNeuter or sterile insectsSummary\n\nThe subject of instinct might have been worked into the previous chapters\nbut I have thought that it would be more convenient to treat the subject\nseparately especially as so wonderful an instinct as that of the hivebee\nmaking its cells will probably have occurred to many readers as a\ndifficulty sufficient to overthrow my whole theory I must premise that I\nhave nothing to do with the origin of the primary mental powers any more\nthan I have with that of life itself We are concerned only with the\ndiversities of instinct and of the other mental qualities of animals within\nthe same class\n\nI will not attempt any definition of instinct It would be easy to show\nthat several distinct mental actions are commonly embraced by this term\nbut every one understands what is meant when it is said that instinct\nimpels the cuckoo to migrate and to lay her eggs in other birds nests An\naction which we ourselves should require experience to enable us to\nperform when performed by an animal more especially by a very young one\nwithout any experience and when performed by many individuals in the same\nway without their knowing for what purpose it is performed is usually\nsaid to be instinctive 208 But I could show that none of these\ncharacters of instinct are universal A little dose as Pierre Huber\nexpresses it of judgment or reason often comes into play even in animals\nvery low in the scale of nature\n\nFrederick Cuvier and several of the older metaphysicians have compared\ninstinct with habit This comparison gives I think a remarkably accurate\nnotion of the frame of mind under which an instinctive action is performed\nbut not of its origin How unconsciously many habitual actions are\nperformed indeed not rarely in direct opposition to our conscious will\nyet they may be modified by the will or reason Habits easily become\nassociated with other habits and with certain periods of time and states\nof the body When once acquired they often remain constant throughout\nlife Several other points of resemblance between instincts and habits\ncould be pointed out As in repeating a wellknown song so in instincts\none action follows another by a sort of rhythm if a person be interrupted\nin a song or in repeating anything by rote he is generally forced to go\nback to recover the habitual train of thought: so P Huber found it was\nwith a caterpillar which makes a very complicated hammock for if he took\na caterpillar which had completed its hammock up to say the sixth stage\nof construction and put it into a hammock completed up only to the third\nstage the caterpillar simply reperformed the fourth fifth and sixth\nstages of construction If however a caterpillar were taken out of a\nhammock made up for instance to the third stage and were put into one\nfinished up to the sixth stage so that much of its work was already done\nfor it far from feeling the benefit of this it was much embarrassed and\nin order to complete its hammock seemed forced to start from the third\nstage where it had left off and thus tried to complete the already\nfinished work 209\n\nIf we suppose any habitual action to become inheritedand I think it can\nbe shown that this does sometimes happenthen the resemblance between what\noriginally was a habit and an instinct becomes so close as not to be\ndistinguished If Mozart instead of playing the pianoforte at three years\nold with wonderfully little practice had played a tune with no practice at\nall he might truly be said to have done so instinctively But it would be\nthe most serious error to suppose that the greater number of instincts have\nbeen acquired by habit in one generation and then transmitted by\ninheritance to succeeding generations It can be clearly shown that the\nmost wonderful instincts with which we are acquainted namely those of the\nhivebee and of many ants could not possibly have been thus acquired\n\nIt will be universally admitted that instincts are as important as\ncorporeal structure for the welfare of each species under its present\nconditions of life Under changed conditions of life it is at least\npossible that slight modifications of instinct might be profitable to a\nspecies and if it can be shown that instincts do vary ever so little then\nI can see no difficulty in natural selection preserving and continually\naccumulating variations of instinct to any extent that may be profitable\nIt is thus as I believe that all the most complex and wonderful instincts\nhave originated As modifications of corporeal structure arise from and\nare increased by use or habit and are diminished or lost by disuse so I\ndo not doubt it has been with instincts But I believe that the effects of\nhabit are of quite subordinate importance to the effects of the natural\nselection of what may be called accidental variations of instinctsthat\nis of variations produced by the same unknown causes which produce slight\ndeviations of bodily structure\n\nNo complex instinct can possibly be produced through 210 natural\nselection except by the slow and gradual accumulation of numerous slight\nyet profitable variations Hence as in the case of corporeal structures\nwe ought to find in nature not the actual transitional gradations by which\neach complex instinct has been acquiredfor these could be found only in\nthe lineal ancestors of each speciesbut we ought to find in the\ncollateral lines of descent some evidence of such gradations or we ought\nat least to be able to show that gradations of some kind are possible and\nthis we certainly can do I have been surprised to find making allowance\nfor the instincts of animals having been but little observed except in\nEurope and North America and for no instinct being known amongst extinct\nspecies how very generally gradations leading to the most complex\ninstincts can be discovered Changes of instinct may sometimes be\nfacilitated by the same species having different instincts at different\nperiods of life or at different seasons of the year or when placed under\ndifferent circumstances c in which case either one or the other instinct\nmight be preserved by natural selection And such instances of diversity of\ninstinct in the same species can be shown to occur in nature\n\nAgain as in the case of corporeal structure and conformably with my\ntheory the instinct of each species is good for itself but has never as\nfar as we can judge been produced for the exclusive good of others One of\nthe strongest instances of an animal apparently performing an action for\nthe sole good of another with which I am acquainted is that of aphides\nvoluntarily yielding their sweet excretion to ants: that they do so\nvoluntarily the following facts show I removed all the ants from a group\nof about a dozen aphides on a dockplant and prevented their attendance\nduring several hours After this interval I felt sure that the aphides\n211 would want to excrete I watched them for some time through a lens\nbut not one excreted I then tickled and stroked them with a hair in the\nsame manner as well as I could as the ants do with their antenn but not\none excreted Afterwards I allowed an ant to visit them and it immediately\nseemed by its eager way of running about to be well aware what a rich\nflock it had discovered it then began to play with its antenn on the\nabdomen first of one aphis and then of another and each aphis as soon as\nit felt the antenn immediately lifted up its abdomen and excreted a\nlimpid drop of sweet juice which was eagerly devoured by the ant Even the\nquite young aphides behaved in this manner showing that the action was\ninstinctive and not the result of experience But as the excretion is\nextremely viscid it is probably a convenience to the aphides to have it\nremoved and therefore probably the aphides do not instinctively excrete\nfor the sole good of the ants Although I do not believe that any animal in\nthe world performs an action for the exclusive good of another of a\ndistinct species yet each species tries to take advantage of the instincts\nof others as each takes advantage of the weaker bodily structure of\nothers So again in some few cases certain instincts cannot be considered\nas absolutely perfect but as details on this and other such points are not\nindispensable they may be here passed over\n\nAs some degree of variation in instincts under a state of nature and the\ninheritance of such variations are indispensable for the action of natural\nselection as many instances as possible ought to be here given but want\nof space prevents me I can only assert that instincts certainly do\nvaryfor instance the migratory instinct both in extent and direction\nand in its total loss So it is with the nests of birds which vary partly\n212 in dependence on the situations chosen and on the nature and\ntemperature of the country inhabited but often from causes wholly unknown\nto us: Audubon has given several remarkable cases of differences in the\nnests of the same species in the northern and southern United States Fear\nof any particular enemy is certainly an instinctive quality as may be seen\nin nestling birds though it is strengthened by experience and by the\nsight of fear of the same enemy in other animals But fear of man is slowly\nacquired as I have elsewhere shown by various animals inhabiting desert\nislands and we may see an instance of this even in England in the\ngreater wildness of all our large birds than of our small birds for the\nlarge birds have been most persecuted by man We may safely attribute the\ngreater wildness of our large birds to this cause for in uninhabited\nislands large birds are not more fearful than small and the magpie so\nwary in England is tame in Norway as is the hooded crow in Egypt\n\nThat the general disposition of individuals of the same species born in a\nstate of nature is extremely diversified can be shown by a multitude of\nfacts Several cases also could be given of occasional and strange habits\nin certain species which might if advantageous to the species give rise\nthrough natural selection to quite new instincts But I am well aware that\nthese general statements without facts given in detail can produce but a\nfeeble effect on the readers mind I can only repeat my assurance that I\ndo not speak without good evidence\n\nThe possibility or even probability of inherited variations of instinct\nin a state of nature will be strengthened by briefly considering a few\ncases under domestication We shall thus also be enabled to see the\nrespective parts which habit and the selection of 213 socalled\naccidental variations have played in modifying the mental qualities of our\ndomestic animals A number of curious and authentic instances could be\ngiven of the inheritance of all shades of disposition and tastes and\nlikewise of the oddest tricks associated with certain frames of mind or\nperiods of time But let us look to the familiar case of the several breeds\nof dogs: it cannot be doubted that young pointers I have myself seen a\nstriking instance will sometimes point and even back other dogs the very\nfirst time that they are taken out retrieving is certainly in some degree\ninherited by retrievers and a tendency to run round instead of at a\nflock of sheep by shepherddogs I cannot see that these actions\nperformed without experience by the young and in nearly the same manner by\neach individual performed with eager delight by each breed and without\nthe end being knownfor the young pointer can no more know that he points\nto aid his master than the white butterfly knows why she lays her eggs on\nthe leaf of the cabbageI cannot see that these actions differ\nessentially from true instincts If we were to see one kind of wolf when\nyoung and without any training as soon as it scented its prey stand\nmotionless like a statue and then slowly crawl forward with a peculiar\ngait and another kind of wolf rushing round instead of at a herd of\ndeer and driving them to a distant point we should assuredly call these\nactions instinctive Domestic instincts as they may be called are\ncertainly far less fixed or invariable than natural instincts but they\nhave been acted on by far less rigorous selection and have been\ntransmitted for an incomparably shorter period under less fixed conditions\nof life\n\nHow strongly these domestic instincts habits and dispositions are\ninherited and how curiously they become mingled is well shown when\ndifferent breeds of dogs are 214 crossed Thus it is known that a cross\nwith a bulldog has affected for many generations the courage and obstinacy\nof greyhounds and a cross with a greyhound has given to a whole family of\nshepherddogs a tendency to hunt hares These domestic instincts when thus\ntested by crossing resemble natural instincts which in a like manner\nbecome curiously blended together and for a long period exhibit traces of\nthe instincts of either parent: for example Le Roy describes a dog whose\ngreatgrandfather was a wolf and this dog showed a trace of its wild\nparentage only in one way by not coming in a straight line to his master\nwhen called\n\nDomestic instincts are sometimes spoken of as actions which have become\ninherited solely from longcontinued and compulsory habit but this I\nthink is not true No one would ever have thought of teaching or probably\ncould have taught the tumblerpigeon to tumblean action which as I\nhave witnessed is performed by young birds that have never seen a pigeon\ntumble We may believe that some one pigeon showed a slight tendency to\nthis strange habit and that the longcontinued selection of the best\nindividuals in successive generations made tumblers what they now are and\nnear Glasgow there are housetumblers as I hear from Mr Brent which\ncannot fly eighteen inches high without going head over heels It may be\ndoubted whether any one would have thought of training a dog to point had\nnot some one dog naturally shown a tendency in this line and this is known\noccasionally to happen as I once saw in a pure terrier: the act of\npointing is probably as many have thought only the exaggerated pause of\nan animal preparing to spring on its prey When the first tendency to point\nwas once displayed methodical selection and the inherited effects of\ncompulsory training in each successive generation would soon complete the\n215 work and unconscious selection is still at work as each man tries\nto procure without intending to improve the breed dogs which will stand\nand hunt best On the other hand habit alone in some cases has sufficed\nno animal is more difficult to tame than the young of the wild rabbit\nscarcely any animal is tamer than the young of the tame rabbit but I do\nnot suppose that domestic rabbits have ever been selected for tameness and\nI presume that we must attribute the whole of the inherited change from\nextreme wildness to extreme tameness simply to habit and longcontinued\nclose confinement\n\nNatural instincts are lost under domestication: a remarkable instance of\nthis is seen in those breeds of fowls which very rarely or never become\nbroody that is never wish to sit on their eggs Familiarity alone\nprevents our seeing how universally and largely the minds of our domestic\nanimals have been modified by domestication It is scarcely possible to\ndoubt that the love of man has become instinctive in the dog All wolves\nfoxes jackals and species of the cat genus when kept tame are most\neager to attack poultry sheep and pigs and this tendency has been found\nincurable in dogs which have been brought home as puppies from countries\nsuch as Tierra del Fuego and Australia where the savages do not keep these\ndomestic animals How rarely on the other hand do our civilised dogs\neven when quite young require to be taught not to attack poultry sheep\nand pigs No doubt they occasionally do make an attack and are then\nbeaten and if not cured they are destroyed so that habit with some\ndegree of selection has probably concurred in civilising by inheritance\nour dogs On the other hand young chickens have lost wholly by habit\nthat fear of the dog and cat which no doubt was originally instinctive in\nthem in the same way as it is so plainly instinctive in 216 young\npheasants though reared under a hen It is not that chickens have lost all\nfear but fear only of dogs and cats for if the hen gives the\ndangerchuckle they will run more especially young turkeys from under\nher and conceal themselves in the surrounding grass or thickets and this\nis evidently done for the instinctive purpose of allowing as we see in\nwild groundbirds their mother to fly away But this instinct retained by\nour chickens has become useless under domestication for the motherhen has\nalmost lost by disuse the power of flight\n\nHence we may conclude that domestic instincts have been acquired and\nnatural instincts have been lost partly by habit and partly by man\nselecting and accumulating during successive generations peculiar mental\nhabits and actions which at first appeared from what we must in our\nignorance call an accident In some cases compulsory habit alone has\nsufficed to produce such inherited mental changes in other cases\ncompulsory habit has done nothing and all has been the result of\nselection pursued both methodically and unconsciously but in most cases\nprobably habit and selection have acted together\n\nWe shall perhaps best understand how instincts in a state of nature have\nbecome modified by selection by considering a few cases I will select\nonly three out of the several which I shall have to discuss in my future\nworknamely the instinct which leads the cuckoo to lay her eggs in other\nbirds nests the slavemaking instinct of certain ants and the\ncombmaking power of the hivebee these two latter instincts have\ngenerally and most justly been ranked by naturalists as the most\nwonderful of all known instincts\n\nIt is now commonly admitted that the more immediate and final cause of the\ncuckoos instinct is that 217 she lays her eggs not daily but at\nintervals of two or three days so that if she were to make her own nest\nand sit on her own eggs those first laid would have to be left for some\ntime unincubated or there would be eggs and young birds of different ages\nin the same nest If this were the case the process of laying and hatching\nmight be inconveniently long more especially as she has to migrate at a\nvery early period and the first hatched young would probably have to be\nfed by the male alone But the American cuckoo is in this predicament for\nshe makes her own nest and has eggs and young successively hatched all at\nthe same time It has been asserted that the American cuckoo occasionally\nlays her eggs in other birds nests but I hear on the high authority of\nDr Brewer that this is a mistake Nevertheless I could give several\ninstances of various birds which have been known occasionally to lay their\neggs in other birds nests Now let us suppose that the ancient progenitor\nof our European cuckoo had the habits of the American cuckoo but that\noccasionally she laid an egg in another birds nest If the old bird\nprofited by this occasional habit or if the young were made more vigorous\nby advantage having been taken of the mistaken maternal instinct of another\nbird than by their own mothers care encumbered as she can hardly fail to\nbe by having eggs and young of different ages at the same time then the\nold birds or the fostered young would gain an advantage And analogy would\nlead me to believe that the young thus reared would be apt to follow by\ninheritance the occasional and aberrant habit of their mother and in their\nturn would be apt to lay their eggs in other birds nests and thus be\nsuccessful in rearing their young By a continued process of this nature I\nbelieve that the strange instinct of our cuckoo could be and has been\n218 generated I may add that according to Dr Gray and to some other\nobservers the European cuckoo has not utterly lost all maternal love and\ncare for her own offspring\n\nThe occasional habit of birds laying their eggs in other birds nests\neither of the same or of a distinct species is not very uncommon with the\nGallinace and this perhaps explains the origin of a singular instinct in\nthe allied group of ostriches For several hen ostriches at least in the\ncase of the American species unite and lay first a few eggs in one nest\nand then in another and these are hatched by the males This instinct may\nprobably be accounted for by the fact of the hens laying a large number of\neggs but as in the case of the cuckoo at intervals of two or three days\nThis instinct however of the American ostrich has not as yet been\nperfected for a surprising number of eggs lie strewed over the plains so\nthat in one days hunting I picked up no less than twenty lost and wasted\neggs\n\nMany bees are parasitic and always lay their eggs in the nests of bees of\nother kinds This case is more remarkable than that of the cuckoo for\nthese bees have not only their instincts but their structure modified in\naccordance with their parasitic habits for they do not possess the\npollencollecting apparatus which would be necessary if they had to store\nfood for their own young Some species likewise of Sphegid wasplike\ninsects are parasitic on other species and M Fabre has lately shown good\nreason for believing that although the Tachytes nigra generally makes its\nown burrow and stores it with paralysed prey for its own larv to feed on\nyet that when this insect finds a burrow already made and stored by another\nsphex it takes advantage of the prize and becomes for the occasion\nparasitic In this case as with the supposed case of the cuckoo I can\n219 see no difficulty in natural selection making an occasional habit\npermanent if of advantage to the species and if the insect whose nest and\nstored food are thus feloniously appropriated be not thus exterminated\n\n\n\nSlavemaking instinctThis remarkable instinct was first discovered in\nthe Formica Polyerges rufescens by Pierre Huber a better observer even\nthan his celebrated father This ant is absolutely dependent on its slaves\nwithout their aid the species would certainly become extinct in a single\nyear The males and fertile females do no work The workers or sterile\nfemales though most energetic and courageous in capturing slaves do no\nother work They are incapable of making their own nests or of feeding\ntheir own larv When the old nest is found inconvenient and they have to\nmigrate it is the slaves which determine the migration and actually carry\ntheir masters in their jaws So utterly helpless are the masters that when\nHuber shut up thirty of them without a slave but with plenty of the food\nwhich they like best and with their larvae and pup to stimulate them to\nwork they did nothing they could not even feed themselves and many\nperished of hunger Huber then introduced a single slave F fusca and\nshe instantly set to work fed and saved the survivors made some cells and\ntended the larv and put all to rights What can be more extraordinary\nthan these wellascertained facts If we had not known of any other\nslavemaking ant it would have been hopeless to have speculated how so\nwonderful an instinct could have been perfected\n\nAnother species Formica sanguinea was likewise first discovered by P\nHuber to be a slavemaking ant This species is found in the southern parts\nof England and its habits have been attended to by Mr F Smith of 220\nthe British Museum to whom I am much indebted for information on this and\nother subjects Although fully trusting to the statements of Huber and Mr\nSmith I tried to approach the subject in a sceptical frame of mind as any\none may well be excused for doubting the truth of so extraordinary and\nodious an instinct as that of making slaves Hence I will give the\nobservations which I have myself made in some little detail I opened\nfourteen nests of F sanguinea and found a few slaves in all Males and\nfertile females of the slavespecies F fusca are found only in their own\nproper communities and have never been observed in the nests of F\nsanguinea The slaves are black and not above half the size of their red\nmasters so that the contrast in their appearance is very great When the\nnest is slightly disturbed the slaves occasionally come out and like\ntheir masters are much agitated and defend the nest: when the nest is much\ndisturbed and the larv and pup are exposed the slaves work energetically\nwith their masters in carrying them away to a place of safety Hence it is\nclear that the slaves feel quite at home During the months of June and\nJuly on three successive years I have watched for many hours several\nnests in Surrey and Sussex and never saw a slave either leave or enter a\nnest As during these months the slaves are very few in number I thought\nthat they might behave differently when more numerous but Mr Smith\ninforms me that he has watched the nests at various hours during May June\nand August both in Surrey and Hampshire and has never seen the slaves\nthrough present in large numbers in August either leave or enter the nest\nHence he considers them as strictly household slaves The masters on the\nother hand may be constantly seen bringing in materials for the nest and\nfood of all kinds During the present year however in the month 221 of\nJuly I came across a community with an unusually large stock of slaves\nand I observed a few slaves mingled with their masters leaving the nest\nand marching along the same road to a tall Scotchfirtree twentyfive\nyards distant which they ascended together probably in search of aphides\nor cocci According to Huber who had ample opportunities for observation\nin Switzerland the slaves habitually work with their masters in making the\nnest and they alone open and close the doors in the morning and evening\nand as Huber expressly states their principal office is to search for\naphides This difference in the usual habits of the masters and slaves in\nthe two countries probably depends merely on the slaves being captured in\ngreater numbers in Switzerland than in England\n\nOne day I fortunately witnessed a migration of F sanguinea from one nest\nto another and it was a most interesting spectacle to behold the masters\ncarefully carrying instead of being carried by as in the case of F\nrufescens their slaves in their jaws Another day my attention was struck\nby about a score of the slavemakers haunting the same spot and evidently\nnot in search of food they approached and were vigorously repulsed by an\nindependent community of the slavespecies F fusca sometimes as many as\nthree of these ants clinging to the legs of the slavemaking F sanguinea\nThe latter ruthlessly killed their small opponents and carried their dead\nbodies as food to their nest twentynine yards distant but they were\nprevented from getting any pup to rear as slaves I then dug up a small\nparcel of the pup of F fusca from another nest and put them down on a\nbare spot near the place of combat they were eagerly seized and carried\noff by the tyrants who perhaps fancied that after all they had been\nvictorious in their late combat 222\n\nAt the same time I laid on the same place a small parcel of the pup of\nanother species F flava with a few of these little yellow ants still\nclinging to the fragments of the nest This species is sometimes though\nrarely made into slaves as has been described by Mr Smith Although so\nsmall a species it is very courageous and I have seen it ferociously\nattack other ants In one instance I found to my surprise an independent\ncommunity of F flava under a stone beneath a nest of the slavemaking F\nsanguinea and when I had accidentally disturbed both nests the little\nants attacked their big neighbours with surprising courage Now I was\ncurious to ascertain whether F sanguinea could distinguish the pup of F\nfusca which they habitually make into slaves from those of the little and\nfurious F flava which they rarely capture and it was evident that they\ndid at once distinguish them: for we have seen that they eagerly and\ninstantly seized the pup of F fusca whereas they were much terrified\nwhen they came across the pup or even the earth from the nest of F\nflava and quickly ran away but in about a quarter of an hour shortly\nafter all the little yellow ants had crawled away they took heart and\ncarried off the pup\n\nOne evening I visited another community of F sanguinea and found a number\nof these ants returning home and entering their nests carrying the dead\nbodies of F fusca showing that it was not a migration and numerous pup\nI traced a long file of ants burthened with booty for about forty yards\nto a very thick clump of heath whence I saw the last individual of F\nsanguinea emerge carrying a pupa but I was not able to find the desolated\nnest in the thick heath The nest however must have been close at hand\nfor two or three individuals of F fusca were rushing about in the greatest\n223 agitation and one was perched motionless with its own pupa in its\nmouth on the top of a spray of heath an image of despair over its ravaged\nhome\n\nSuch are the facts though they did not need confirmation by me in regard\nto the wonderful instinct of making slaves Let it be observed what a\ncontrast the instinctive habits of F sanguinea present with those of the\ncontinental F rufescens The latter does not build its own nest does not\ndetermine its own migrations does not collect food for itself or its\nyoung and cannot even feed itself: it is absolutely dependent on its\nnumerous slaves Formica sanguinea on the other hand possesses much fewer\nslaves and in the early part of the summer extremely few: the masters\ndetermine when and where a new nest shall be formed and when they migrate\nthe masters carry the slaves Both in Switzerland and England the slaves\nseem to have the exclusive care of the larv and the masters alone go on\nslavemaking expeditions In Switzerland the slaves and masters work\ntogether making and bringing materials for the nest: both but chiefly the\nslaves tend and milk as it may be called their aphides and thus both\ncollect food for the community In England the masters alone usually leave\nthe nest to collect building materials and food for themselves their\nslaves and larv So that the masters in this country receive much less\nservice from their slaves than they do in Switzerland\n\nBy what steps the instinct of F sanguinea originated I will not pretend to\nconjecture But as ants which are not slavemakers will as I have seen\ncarry off pup of other species if scattered near their nests it is\npossible that such pup originally stored as food might become developed\nand the foreign ants thus unintentionally reared would then follow their\nproper instincts and do 224 what work they could If their presence\nproved useful to the species which had seized themif it were more\nadvantageous to this species to capture workers than to procreate themthe\nhabit of collecting pupae originally for food might by natural selection be\nstrengthened and rendered permanent for the very different purpose of\nraising slaves When the instinct was once acquired if carried out to a\nmuch less extent even than in our British F sanguinea which as we have\nseen is less aided by its slaves than the same species in Switzerland I\ncan see no difficulty in natural selection increasing and modifying the\ninstinctalways supposing each modification to be of use to the\nspeciesuntil an ant was formed as abjectly dependent on its slaves as is\nthe Formica rufescens\n\n\n\nCellmaking instinct of the HiveBeeI will not here enter on minute\ndetails on this subject but will merely give an outline of the conclusions\nat which I have arrived He must be a dull man who can examine the\nexquisite structure of a comb so beautifully adapted to its end without\nenthusiastic admiration We hear from mathematicians that bees have\npractically solved a recondite problem and have made their cells of the\nproper shape to hold the greatest possible amount of honey with the least\npossible consumption of precious wax in their construction It has been\nremarked that a skilful workman with fitting tools and measures would\nfind it very difficult to make cells of wax of the true form though this\nis perfectly effected by a crowd of bees working in a dark hive Grant\nwhatever instincts you please and it seems at first quite inconceivable\nhow they can make all the necessary angles and planes or even perceive\nwhen they are correctly made But the difficulty is not 225 nearly so\ngreat as it at first appears: all this beautiful work can be shown I\nthink to follow from a few very simple instincts\n\nI was led to investigate this subject by Mr Waterhouse who has shown that\nthe form of the cell stands in close relation to the presence of adjoining\ncells and the following view may perhaps be considered only as a\nmodification of his theory Let us look to the great principle of\ngradation and see whether Nature does not reveal to us her method of work\nAt one end of a short series we have humblebees which use their old\ncocoons to hold honey sometimes adding to them short tubes of wax and\nlikewise making separate and very irregular rounded cells of wax At the\nother end of the series we have the cells of the hivebee placed in a\ndouble layer: each cell as is well known is an hexagonal prism with the\nbasal edges of its six sides bevelled so as to fit on to a pyramid formed\nof three rhombs These rhombs have certain angles and the three which form\nthe pyramidal base of a single cell on one side of the comb enter into the\ncomposition of the bases of three adjoining cells on the opposite side In\nthe series between the extreme perfection of the cells of the hivebee and\nthe simplicity of those of the humblebee we have the cells of the Mexican\nMelipona domestica carefully described and figured by Pierre Huber The\nMelipona itself is intermediate in structure between the hive and humble\nbee but more nearly related to the latter: it forms a nearly regular waxen\ncomb of cylindrical cells in which the young are hatched and in\naddition some large cells of wax for holding honey These latter cells are\nnearly spherical and of nearly equal sizes and are aggregated into an\nirregular mass But the important point to notice is that these cells are\nalways made at that degree of nearness to each other that they would have\n226 intersected or broken into each other if the spheres had been\ncompleted but this is never permitted the bees building perfectly flat\nwalls of wax between the spheres which thus tend to intersect Hence each\ncell consists of an outer spherical portion and of two three or more\nperfectly flat surfaces according as the cell adjoins two three or more\nother cells When one cell comes into contact with three other cells\nwhich from the spheres being nearly of the same size is very frequently\nand necessarily the case the three flat surfaces are united into a\npyramid and this pyramid as Huber has remarked is manifestly a gross\nimitation of the threesided pyramidal bases of the cell of the hivebee\nAs in the cells of the hivebee so here the three plane surfaces in any\none cell necessarily enter into the construction of three adjoining cells\nIt is obvious that the Melipona saves wax by this manner of building for\nthe flat walls between the adjoining cells are not double but are of the\nsame thickness as the outer spherical portions and yet each flat portion\nforms a part of two cells\n\nReflecting on this case it occurred to me that if the Melipona had made\nits spheres at some given distance from each other and had made them of\nequal sizes and had arranged them symmetrically in a double layer the\nresulting structure would probably have been as perfect as the comb of the\nhivebee Accordingly I wrote to Professor Miller of Cambridge and this\ngeometer has kindly read over the following statement drawn up from his\ninformation and tells me that it is strictly correct:\n\nIf a number of equal spheres be described with their centres placed in two\nparallel layers with the centre of each sphere at the distance of radius \nroot2 or radius  141421 or at some lesser distance from the centres\nof the six surrounding spheres in the same 227 layer and at the same\ndistance from the centres of the adjoining spheres in the other and\nparallel layer then if planes of intersection between the several spheres\nin both layers be formed there will result a double layer of hexagonal\nprisms united together by pyramidal bases formed of three rhombs and the\nrhombs and the sides of the hexagonal prisms will have every angle\nidentically the same with the best measurements which have been made of the\ncells of the hivebee\n\nHence we may safely conclude that if we could slightly modify the instincts\nalready possessed by the Melipona and in themselves not very wonderful\nthis bee would make a structure as wonderfully perfect as that of the\nhivebee We must suppose the Melipona to make her cells truly spherical\nand of equal sizes and this would not be very surprising seeing that she\nalready does so to a certain extent and seeing what perfectly cylindrical\nburrows in wood many insects can make apparently by turning round on a\nfixed point We must suppose the Melipona to arrange her cells in level\nlayers as she already does her cylindrical cells and we must further\nsuppose and this is the greatest difficulty that she can somehow judge\naccurately at what distance to stand from her fellowlabourers when several\nare making their spheres but she is already so far enabled to judge of\ndistance that she always describes her spheres so as to intersect largely\nand then she unites the points of intersection by perfectly flat surfaces\nWe have further to suppose but this is no difficulty that after hexagonal\nprisms have been formed by the intersection of adjoining spheres in the\nsame layer she can prolong the hexagon to any length requisite to hold the\nstock of honey in the same way as the rude humblebee adds cylinders of\nwax to the circular mouths of her old cocoons By such 228 modifications\nof instincts in themselves not very wonderfulhardly more wonderful than\nthose which guide a bird to make its nestI believe that the hivebee has\nacquired through natural selection her inimitable architectural powers\n\nBut this theory can be tested by experiment Following the example of Mr\nTegetmeier I separated two combs and put between them a long thick\nsquare strip of wax: the bees instantly began to excavate minute circular\npits in it and as they deepened these little pits they made them wider\nand wider until they were converted into shallow basins appearing to the\neye perfectly true or parts of a sphere and of about the diameter of a\ncell It was most interesting to me to observe that wherever several bees\nhad begun to excavate these basins near together they had begun their work\nat such a distance from each other that by the time the basins had\nacquired the above stated width ie about the width of an ordinary\ncell and were in depth about one sixth of the diameter of the sphere of\nwhich they formed a part the rims of the basins intersected or broke into\neach other As soon as this occurred the bees ceased to excavate and\nbegan to build up flat walls of wax on the lines of intersection between\nthe basins so that each hexagonal prism was built upon the scalloped edge\nof a smooth basin instead of on the straight edges of a threesided\npyramid as in the case of ordinary cells\n\nI then put into the hive instead of a thick square piece of wax a thin\nand narrow knifeedged ridge coloured with vermilion The bees instantly\nbegan on both sides to excavate little basins near to each other in the\nsame way as before but the ridge of wax was so thin that the bottoms of\nthe basins if they had been excavated to the same depth as in the former\n229 experiment would have broken into each other from the opposite\nsides The bees however did not suffer this to happen and they stopped\ntheir excavations in due time so that the basins as soon as they had been\na little deepened came to have flat bottoms and these flat bottoms\nformed by thin little plates of the vermilion wax having been left\nungnawed were situated as far as the eye could judge exactly along the\nplanes of imaginary intersection between the basins on the opposite sides\nof the ridge of wax In parts only little bits in other parts large\nportions of a rhombic plate had been left between the opposed basins but\nthe work from the unnatural state of things had not been neatly\nperformed The bees must have worked at very nearly the same rate on the\nopposite sides of the ridge of vermilion wax as they circularly gnawed\naway and deepened the basins on both sides in order to have succeeded in\nthus leaving flat plates between the basins by stopping work along the\nintermediate planes or planes of intersection\n\nConsidering how flexible thin wax is I do not see that there is any\ndifficulty in the bees whilst at work on the two sides of a strip of wax\nperceiving when they have gnawed the wax away to the proper thinness and\nthen stopping their work In ordinary combs it has appeared to me that the\nbees do not always succeed in working at exactly the same rate from the\nopposite sides for I have noticed halfcompleted rhombs at the base of a\njustcommenced cell which were slightly concave on one side where I\nsuppose that the bees had excavated too quickly and convex on the opposed\nside where the bees had worked less quickly In one wellmarked instance\nI put the comb back into the hive and allowed the bees to go on working\nfor a short time and again examined the cell and I found that the rhombic\n230 plate had been completed and had become perfectly flat: it was\nabsolutely impossible from the extreme thinness of the little rhombic\nplate that they could have effected this by gnawing away the convex side\nand I suspect that the bees in such cases stand in the opposed cells and\npush and bend the ductile and warm wax which as I have tried is easily\ndone into its proper intermediate plane and thus flatten it\n\nFrom the experiment of the ridge of vermilion wax we can clearly see that\nif the bees were to build for themselves a thin wall of wax they could\nmake their cells of the proper shape by standing at the proper distance\nfrom each other by excavating at the same rate and by endeavouring to\nmake equal spherical hollows but never allowing the spheres to break into\neach other Now bees as may be clearly seen by examining the edge of a\ngrowing comb do make a rough circumferential wall or rim all round the\ncomb and they gnaw into this from the opposite sides always working\ncircularly as they deepen each cell They do not make the whole threesided\npyramidal base of any one cell at the same time but only the one rhombic\nplate which stands on the extreme growing margin or the two plates as the\ncase may be and they never complete the upper edges of the rhombic plates\nuntil the hexagonal walls are commenced Some of these statements differ\nfrom those made by the justly celebrated elder Huber but I am convinced of\ntheir accuracy and if I had space I could show that they are conformable\nwith my theory\n\nHubers statement that the very first cell is excavated out of a little\nparallelsided wall of wax is not as far as I have seen strictly\ncorrect the first commencement having always been a little hood of wax\nbut I will not here enter on these details We see how important 231 a\npart excavation plays in the construction of the cells but it would be a\ngreat error to suppose that the bees cannot build up a rough wall of wax in\nthe proper positionthat is along the plane of intersection between two\nadjoining spheres I have several specimens showing clearly that they can\ndo this Even in the rude circumferential rim or wall of wax round a\ngrowing comb flexures may sometimes be observed corresponding in position\nto the planes of the rhombic basal plates of future cells But the rough\nwall of wax has in every case to be finished off by being largely gnawed\naway on both sides The manner in which the bees build is curious they\nalways make the first rough wall from ten to twenty times thicker than the\nexcessively thin finished wall of the cell which will ultimately be left\nWe shall understand how they work by supposing masons first to pile up a\nbroad ridge of cement and then to begin cutting it away equally on both\nsides near the ground till a smooth very thin wall is left in the middle\nthe masons always piling up the cutaway cement and adding fresh cement\non the summit of the ridge We shall thus have a thin wall steadily growing\nupward but always crowned by a gigantic coping From all the cells both\nthose just commenced and those completed being thus crowned by a strong\ncoping of wax the bees can cluster and crawl over the comb without\ninjuring the delicate hexagonal walls which are only about one\nfourhundredth of an inch in thickness the plates of the pyramidal basis\nbeing about twice as thick By this singular manner of building strength\nis continually given to the comb with the utmost ultimate economy of wax\n\nIt seems at first to add to the difficulty of understanding how the cells\nare made that a multitude of bees all work together one bee after working\na short time at one cell going to another so that as Huber has stated\n232 a score of individuals work even at the commencement of the first\ncell I was able practically to show this fact by covering the edges of\nthe hexagonal walls of a single cell or the extreme margin of the\ncircumferential rim of a growing comb with an extremely thin layer of\nmelted vermilion wax and I invariably found that the colour was most\ndelicately diffused by the beesas delicately as a painter could have done\nwith his brushby atoms of the coloured wax having been taken from the\nspot on which it had been placed and worked into the growing edges of the\ncells all round The work of construction seems to be a sort of balance\nstruck between many bees all instinctively standing at the same relative\ndistance from each other all trying to sweep equal spheres and then\nbuilding up or leaving ungnawed the planes of intersection between these\nspheres It was really curious to note in cases of difficulty as when two\npieces of comb met at an angle how often the bees would pull down and\nrebuild in different ways the same cell sometimes recurring to a shape\nwhich they had at first rejected\n\nWhen bees have a place on which they can stand in their proper positions\nfor workingfor instance on a slip of wood placed directly under the\nmiddle of a comb growing downwards so that the comb has to be built over\none face of the slipin this case the bees can lay the foundations of one\nwall of a new hexagon in its strictly proper place projecting beyond the\nother completed cells It suffices that the bees should be enabled to stand\nat their proper relative distances from each other and from the walls of\nthe last completed cells and then by striking imaginary spheres they can\nbuild up a wall intermediate between two adjoining spheres but as far as\nI have seen they never gnaw away and finish off the angles of a cell till\na large part both of that cell and of 233 the adjoining cells has been\nbuilt This capacity in bees of laying down under certain circumstances a\nrough wall in its proper place between two justcommenced cells is\nimportant as it bears on a fact which seems at first quite subversive of\nthe foregoing theory namely that the cells on the extreme margin of\nwaspcombs are sometimes strictly hexagonal but I have not space here to\nenter on this subject Nor does there seem to me any great difficulty in a\nsingle insect as in the case of a queenwasp making hexagonal cells if\nshe work alternately on the inside and outside of two or three cells\ncommenced at the same time always standing at the proper relative distance\nfrom the parts of the cells just begun sweeping spheres or cylinders and\nbuilding up intermediate planes It is even conceivable that an insect\nmight by fixing on a point at which to commence a cell and then moving\noutside first to one point and then to five other points at the proper\nrelative distances from the central point and from each other strike the\nplanes of intersection and so make an isolated hexagon: but I am not aware\nthat any such case has been observed nor would any good be derived from a\nsingle hexagon being built as in its construction more materials would be\nrequired than for a cylinder\n\nAs natural selection acts only by the accumulation of slight modifications\nof structure or instinct each profitable to the individual under its\nconditions of life it may reasonably be asked how a long and graduated\nsuccession of modified architectural instincts all tending towards the\npresent perfect plan of construction could have profited the progenitors\nof the hivebee I think the answer is not difficult: it is known that bees\nare often hard pressed to get sufficient nectar and I am informed by Mr\nTegetmeier that it has been experimentally found that no less than from\ntwelve to fifteen pounds of dry sugar 234 are consumed by a hive of bees\nfor the secretion of each pound of wax to that a prodigious quantity of\nfluid nectar must be collected and consumed by the bees in a hive for the\nsecretion of the wax necessary for the construction of their combs\nMoreover many bees have to remain idle for many days during the process of\nsecretion A large store of honey is indispensable to support a large stock\nof bees during the winter and the security of the hive is known mainly to\ndepend on a large number of bees being supported Hence the saving of wax\nby largely saving honey must be a most important element of success in any\nfamily of bees Of course the success of any species of bee may be\ndependent on the number of its parasites or other enemies or on quite\ndistinct causes and so be altogether independent of the quantity of honey\nwhich the bees could collect But let us suppose that this latter\ncircumstance determined as it probably often does determine the numbers\nof a humblebee which could exist in a country and let us further suppose\nthat the community lived throughout the winter and consequently required a\nstore of honey: there can in this case be no doubt that it would be an\nadvantage to our humblebee if a slight modification of her instinct led\nher to make her waxen cells near together so as to intersect a little for\na wall in common even to two adjoining cells would save some little wax\nHence it would continually be more and more advantageous to our humblebee\nif she were to make her cells more and more regular nearer together and\naggregated into a mass like the cells of the Melipona for in this case a\nlarge part of the bounding surface of each cell would serve to bound other\ncells and much wax would be saved Again from the same cause it would be\nadvantageous to the Melipona if she were to make her cells closer\ntogether and more regular in every way 235 than at present for then as\nwe have seen the spherical surfaces would wholly disappear and would all\nbe replaced by plane surfaces and the Melipona would make a comb as\nperfect as that of the hivebee Beyond this stage of perfection in\narchitecture natural selection could not lead for the comb of the\nhivebee as far as we can see is absolutely perfect in economising wax\n\nThus as I believe the most wonderful of all known instincts that of the\nhivebee can be explained by natural selection having taken advantage of\nnumerous successive slight modifications of simpler instincts natural\nselection having by slow degrees more and more perfectly led the bees to\nsweep equal spheres at a given distance from each other in a double layer\nand to build up and excavate the wax along the planes of intersection The\nbees of course no more knowing that they swept their spheres at one\nparticular distance from each other than they know what are the several\nangles of the hexagonal prisms and of the basal rhombic plates The motive\npower of the process of natural selection having been economy of wax that\nindividual swarm which wasted least honey in the secretion of wax having\nsucceeded best and having transmitted by inheritance its newly acquired\neconomical instinct to new swarms which in their turn will have had the\nbest chance of succeeding in the struggle for existence\n\n\n\nNo doubt many instincts of very difficult explanation could be opposed to\nthe theory of natural selectioncases in which we cannot see how an\ninstinct could possibly have originated cases in which no intermediate\ngradations are known to exist cases of instinct of apparently such\ntrifling importance that they could 236 hardly have been acted on by\nnatural selection cases of instincts almost identically the same in\nanimals so remote in the scale of nature that we cannot account for their\nsimilarity by inheritance from a common parent and must therefore believe\nthat they have been acquired by independent acts of natural selection I\nwill not here enter on these several cases but will confine myself to one\nspecial difficulty which at first appeared to me insuperable and actually\nfatal to my whole theory I allude to the neuters or sterile females in\ninsectcommunities: for these neuters often differ widely in instinct and\nin structure from both the males and fertile females and yet from being\nsterile they cannot propagate their kind\n\nThe subject well deserves to be discussed at great length but I will here\ntake only a single case that of working or sterile ants How the workers\nhave been rendered sterile is a difficulty but not much greater than that\nof any other striking modification of structure for it can be shown that\nsome insects and other articulate animals in a state of nature occasionally\nbecome sterile and if such insects had been social and it had been\nprofitable to the community that a number should have been annually born\ncapable of work but incapable of procreation I can see no very great\ndifficulty in this being effected by natural selection But I must pass\nover this preliminary difficulty The great difficulty lies in the working\nants differing widely from both the males and the fertile females in\nstructure as in the shape of the thorax and in being destitute of wings\nand sometimes of eyes and in instinct As far as instinct alone is\nconcerned the prodigious difference in this respect between the workers\nand the perfect females would have been far better exemplified by the\nhivebee If a working ant or other neuter insect had been an animal 237\nin the ordinary state I should have unhesitatingly assumed that all its\ncharacters had been slowly acquired through natural selection namely by\nan individual having been born with some slight profitable modification of\nstructure this being inherited by its offspring which again varied and\nwere again selected and so onwards But with the working ant we have an\ninsect differing greatly from its parents yet absolutely sterile so that\nit could never have transmitted successively acquired modifications of\nstructure or instinct to its progeny It may well be asked how is it\npossible to reconcile this case with the theory of natural selection\n\nFirst let it be remembered that we have innumerable instances both in our\ndomestic productions and in those in a state of nature of all sorts of\ndifferences of structure which have become correlated to certain ages and\nto either sex We have differences correlated not only to one sex but to\nthat short period alone when the reproductive system is active as in the\nnuptial plumage of many birds and in the hooked jaws of the male salmon\nWe have even slight differences in the horns of different breeds of cattle\nin relation to an artificially imperfect state of the male sex for oxen of\ncertain breeds have longer horns than in other breeds in comparison with\nthe horns of the bulls or cows of these same breeds Hence I can see no\nreal difficulty in any character having become correlated with the sterile\ncondition of certain members of insectcommunities: the difficulty lies in\nunderstanding how such correlated modifications of structure could have\nbeen slowly accumulated by natural selection\n\nThis difficulty though appearing insuperable is lessened or as I\nbelieve disappears when it is remembered that selection may be applied to\nthe family as well as to the individual and may thus gain the 238\ndesired end Thus a wellflavoured vegetable is cooked and the individual\nis destroyed but the horticulturist sows seeds of the same stock and\nconfidently expects to get nearly the same variety: breeders of cattle wish\nthe flesh and fat to be well marbled together the animal has been\nslaughtered but the breeder goes with confidence to the same family I\nhave such faith in the powers of selection that I do not doubt that a\nbreed of cattle always yielding oxen with extraordinarily long horns\ncould be slowly formed by carefully watching which individual bulls and\ncows when matched produced oxen with the longest horns and yet no one ox\ncould ever have propagated its kind Thus I believe it has been with social\ninsects: a slight modification of structure or instinct correlated with\nthe sterile condition of certain members of the community has been\nadvantageous to the community: consequently the fertile males and females\nof the same community flourished and transmitted to their fertile\noffspring a tendency to produce sterile members having the same\nmodification And I believe that this process has been repeated until that\nprodigious amount of difference between the fertile and sterile females of\nthe same species has been produced which we see in many social insects\n\nBut we have not as yet touched on the climax of the difficulty namely the\nfact that the neuters of several ants differ not only from the fertile\nfemales and males but from each other sometimes to an almost incredible\ndegree and are thus divided into two or even three castes The castes\nmoreover do not generally graduate into each other but are perfectly well\ndefined being as distinct from each other as are any two species of the\nsame genus or rather as any two genera of the same family Thus in Eciton\nthere are working and soldier neuters with jaws and instincts\nextraordinarily 239 different: in Cryptocerus the workers of one caste\nalone carry a wonderful sort of shield on their heads the use of which is\nquite unknown: in the Mexican Myrmecocystus the workers of one caste never\nleave the nest they are fed by the workers of another caste and they have\nan enormously developed abdomen which secretes a sort of honey supplying\nthe place of that excreted by the aphides or the domestic cattle as they\nmay be called which our European ants guard or imprison\n\nIt will indeed be thought that I have an overweening confidence in the\nprinciple of natural selection when I do not admit that such wonderful and\nwellestablished facts at once annihilate my theory In the simpler case of\nneuter insects all of one caste or of the same kind which have been\nrendered by natural selection as I believe to be quite possible different\nfrom the fertile males and femalesin this case we may safely conclude\nfrom the analogy of ordinary variations that each successive slight\nprofitable modification did not probably at first appear in all the\nindividual neuters in the same nest but in a few alone and that by the\nlongcontinued selection of the fertile parents which produced most neuters\nwith the profitable modification all the neuters ultimately came to have\nthe desired character On this view we ought occasionally to find\nneuterinsects of the same species in the same nest presenting gradations\nof structure and this we do find even often considering how few\nneuterinsects out of Europe have been carefully examined Mr F Smith has\nshown how surprisingly the neuters of several British ants differ from each\nother in size and sometimes in colour and that the extreme forms can\nsometimes be perfectly linked together by individuals taken out of the same\nnest: I have myself compared perfect gradations of this kind It often\nhappens that the larger or the smaller sized workers 240 are the most\nnumerous or that both large and small are numerous with those of an\nintermediate size scanty in numbers Formica flava has larger and smaller\nworkers with some of intermediate size and in this species as Mr F\nSmith has observed the larger workers have simple eyes ocelli which\nthough small can be plainly distinguished whereas the smaller workers have\ntheir ocelli rudimentary Having carefully dissected several specimens of\nthese workers I can affirm that the eyes are far more rudimentary in the\nsmaller workers than can be accounted for merely by their proportionally\nlesser size and I fully believe though I dare not assert so positively\nthat the workers of intermediate size have their ocelli in an exactly\nintermediate condition So that we here have two bodies of sterile workers\nin the same nest differing not only in size but in their organs of\nvision yet connected by some few members in an intermediate condition I\nmay digress by adding that if the smaller workers had been the most useful\nto the community and those males and females had been continually\nselected which produced more and more of the smaller workers until all\nthe workers had come to be in this condition we should then have had a\nspecies of ant with neuters very nearly in the same condition with those of\nMyrmica For the workers of Myrmica have not even rudiments of ocelli\nthough the male and female ants of this genus have welldeveloped ocelli\n\nI may give one other case: so confidently did I expect to find gradations\nin important points of structure between the different castes of neuters in\nthe same species that I gladly availed myself of Mr F Smiths offer of\nnumerous specimens from the same nest of the driver ant Anomma of West\nAfrica The reader will perhaps best appreciate the amount of difference in\nthese 241 workers by my giving not the actual measurements but a\nstrictly accurate illustration: the difference was the same as if we were\nto see a set of workmen building a house of whom many were five feet four\ninches high and many sixteen feet high but we must suppose that the\nlarger workmen had heads four instead of three times as big as those of the\nsmaller men and jaws nearly five times as big The jaws moreover of the\nworking ants of the several sizes differed wonderfully in shape and in the\nform and number of the teeth But the important fact for us is that though\nthe workers can be grouped into castes of different sizes yet they\ngraduate insensibly into each other as does the widelydifferent structure\nof their jaws I speak confidently on this latter point as Mr Lubbock\nmade drawings for me with the camera lucida of the jaws which I had\ndissected from the workers of the several sizes\n\nWith these facts before me I believe that natural selection by acting on\nthe fertile parents could form a species which should regularly produce\nneuters either all of large size with one form of jaw or all of small\nsize with jaws having a widely different structure or lastly and this is\nour climax of difficulty one set of workers of one size and structure and\nsimultaneously another set of workers of a different size and structurea\ngraduated series having been first formed as in the case of the driver\nant and then the extreme forms from being the most useful to the\ncommunity having been produced in greater and greater numbers through the\nnatural selection of the parents which generated them until none with an\nintermediate structure were produced\n\nThus as I believe the wonderful fact of two distinctly defined castes of\nsterile workers existing in the same nest both widely different from each\nother and from 242 their parents has originated We can see how useful\ntheir production may have been to a social community of insects on the\nsame principle that the division of labour is useful to civilised man As\nants work by inherited instincts and by inherited organs or tools and not\nby acquired knowledge and manufactured instruments a perfect division of\nlabour could be effected with them only by the workers being sterile for\nhad they been fertile they would have intercrossed and their instincts\nand structure would have become blended And nature has as I believe\neffected this admirable division of labour in the communities of ants by\nthe means of natural selection But I am bound to confess that with all\nmy faith in this principle I should never have anticipated that natural\nselection could have been efficient in so high a degree had not the case\nof these neuter insects convinced me of the fact I have therefore\ndiscussed this case at some little but wholly insufficient length in\norder to show the power of natural selection and likewise because this is\nby far the most serious special difficulty which my theory has\nencountered The case also is very interesting as it proves that with\nanimals as with plants any amount of modification in structure can be\neffected by the accumulation of numerous slight and as we must call them\naccidental variations which are in any manner profitable without\nexercise or habit having come into play For no amount of exercise or\nhabit or volition in the utterly sterile members of a community could\npossibly affect the structure or instincts of the fertile members which\nalone leave descendants I am surprised that no one has advanced this\ndemonstrative case of neuter insects against the wellknown doctrine of\nLamarck\n\n\n\nSummaryI have endeavoured briefly in this chapter 243 to show that\nthe mental qualities of our domestic animals vary and that the variations\nare inherited Still more briefly I have attempted to show that instincts\nvary slightly in a state of nature No one will dispute that instincts are\nof the highest importance to each animal Therefore I can see no\ndifficulty under changing conditions of life in natural selection\naccumulating slight modifications of instinct to any extent in any useful\ndirection In some cases habit or use and disuse have probably come into\nplay I do not pretend that the facts given in this chapter strengthen in\nany great degree my theory but none of the cases of difficulty to the\nbest of my judgment annihilate it On the other hand the fact that\ninstincts are not always absolutely perfect and are liable to\nmistakesthat no instinct has been produced for the exclusive good of\nother animals but that each animal takes advantage of the instincts of\nothersthat the canon in natural history of Natura non facit saltum\nis applicable to instincts as well as to corporeal structure and is\nplainly explicable on the foregoing views but is otherwise\ninexplicableall tend to corroborate the theory of natural selection\n\nThis theory is also strengthened by some few other facts in regard to\ninstincts as by that common case of closely allied but certainly\ndistinct species when inhabiting distant parts of the world and living\nunder considerably different conditions of life yet often retaining nearly\nthe same instincts For instance we can understand on the principle of\ninheritance how it is that the thrush of South America lines its nest with\nmud in the same peculiar manner as does our British thrush: how it is that\nthe male wrens Troglodytes of North America build cocknests to roost\nin like the males of our distinct Kittywrensa habit wholly unlike that\nof 244 any other known bird Finally it may not be a logical deduction\nbut to my imagination it is far more satisfactory to look at such instincts\nas the young cuckoo ejecting its fosterbrothersants making slavesthe\nlarvae of ichneumonid feeding within the live bodies of caterpillarsnot\nas specially endowed or created instincts but as small consequences of one\ngeneral law leading to the advancement of all organic beings namely\nmultiply vary let the strongest live and the weakest die\n\n                                   \n\n\n245\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nHYBRIDISM\n\n    Distinction between the sterility of first crosses and of\n    hybridsSterility various in degree not universal affected by close\n    interbreeding removed by domesticationLaws governing the sterility\n    of hybridsSterility not a special endowment but incidental on other\n    differencesCauses of the sterility of first crosses and of\n    hybridsParallelism between the effects of changed conditions of life\n    and crossingFertility of varieties when crossed and of their mongrel\n    offspring not universalHybrids and mongrels compared independently of\n    their fertilitySummary\n\nThe view generally entertained by naturalists is that species when\nintercrossed have been specially endowed with the quality of sterility in\norder to prevent the confusion of all organic forms This view certainly\nseems at first probable for species within the same country could hardly\nhave kept distinct had they been capable of crossing freely The importance\nof the fact that hybrids are very generally sterile has I think been\nmuch underrated by some late writers On the theory of natural selection\nthe case is especially important inasmuch as the sterility of hybrids\ncould not possibly be of any advantage to them and therefore could not\nhave been acquired by the continued preservation of successive profitable\ndegrees of sterility I hope however to be able to show that sterility is\nnot a specially acquired or endowed quality but is incidental on other\nacquired differences\n\nIn treating this subject two classes of facts to a large extent\nfundamentally different have generally been confounded together namely\nthe sterility of two species 246 when first crossed and the sterility of\nthe hybrids produced from them\n\nPure species have of course their organs of reproduction in a perfect\ncondition yet when intercrossed they produce either few or no offspring\nHybrids on the other hand have their reproductive organs functionally\nimpotent as may be clearly seen in the state of the male element in both\nplants and animals though the organs themselves are perfect in structure\nas far as the microscope reveals In the first case the two sexual elements\nwhich go to form the embryo are perfect in the second case they are either\nnot at all developed or are imperfectly developed This distinction is\nimportant when the cause of the sterility which is common to the two\ncases has to be considered The distinction has probably been slurred\nover owing to the sterility in both cases being looked on as a special\nendowment beyond the province of our reasoning powers\n\nThe fertility of varieties that is of the forms known or believed to have\ndescended from common parents when intercrossed and likewise the\nfertility of their mongrel offspring is on my theory of equal importance\nwith the sterility of species for it seems to make a broad and clear\ndistinction between varieties and species\n\nFirst for the sterility of species when crossed and of their hybrid\noffspring It is impossible to study the several memoirs and works of those\ntwo conscientious and admirable observers Klreuter and Grtner who\nalmost devoted their lives to this subject without being deeply impressed\nwith the high generality of some degree of sterility Klreuter makes the\nrule universal but then he cuts the knot for in ten cases in which he\nfound two forms considered by most authors as distinct species quite\nfertile together he unhesitatingly ranks 247 them as varieties Grtner\nalso makes the rule equally universal and he disputes the entire\nfertility of Klreuters ten cases But in these and in many other cases\nGrtner is obliged carefully to count the seeds in order to show that\nthere is any degree of sterility He always compares the maximum number of\nseeds produced by two species when crossed and by their hybrid offspring\nwith the average number produced by both pure parentspecies in a state of\nnature But a serious cause of error seems to me to be here introduced: a\nplant to be hybridised must be castrated and what is often more\nimportant must be secluded in order to prevent pollen being brought to it\nby insects from other plants Nearly all the plants experimentised on by\nGrtner were potted and apparently were kept in a chamber in his house\nThat these processes are often injurious to the fertility of a plant cannot\nbe doubted for Grtner gives in his table about a score of cases of plants\nwhich he castrated and artificially fertilised with their own pollen and\nexcluding all cases such as the Leguminos in which there is an\nacknowledged difficulty in the manipulation half of these twenty plants\nhad their fertility in some degree impaired Moreover as Grtner during\nseveral years repeatedly crossed the primrose and cowslip which we have\nsuch good reason to believe to be varieties and only once or twice\nsucceeded in getting fertile seed as he found the common red and blue\npimpernels Anagallis arvensis and coerulea which the best botanists rank\nas varieties absolutely sterile together and as he came to the same\nconclusion in several other analogous cases it seems to me that we may\nwell be permitted to doubt whether many other species are really so\nsterile when intercrossed as Grtner believes 248\n\nIt is certain on the one hand that the sterility of various species when\ncrossed is so different in degree and graduates away so insensibly and on\nthe other hand that the fertility of pure species is so easily affected by\nvarious circumstances that for all practical purposes it is most difficult\nto say where perfect fertility ends and sterility begins I think no better\nevidence of this can be required than that the two most experienced\nobservers who have ever lived namely Klreuter and Grtner should have\narrived at diametrically opposite conclusions in regard to the very same\nspecies It is also most instructive to comparebut I have not space here\nto enter on detailsthe evidence advanced by our best botanists on the\nquestion whether certain doubtful forms should be ranked as species or\nvarieties with the evidence from fertility adduced by different\nhybridisers or by the same author from experiments made during different\nyears It can thus be shown that neither sterility nor fertility affords\nany clear distinction between species and varieties but that the evidence\nfrom this source graduates away and is doubtful in the same degree as is\nthe evidence derived from other constitutional and structural differences\n\nIn regard to the sterility of hybrids in successive generations though\nGrtner was enabled to rear some hybrids carefully guarding them from a\ncross with either pure parent for six or seven and in one case for ten\ngenerations yet he asserts positively that their fertility never\nincreased but generally greatly decreased I do not doubt that this is\nusually the case and that the fertility often suddenly decreases in the\nfirst few generations Nevertheless I believe that in all these experiments\nthe fertility has been diminished by an independent cause namely from\nclose interbreeding I have collected so large a body of facts showing\n249 that close interbreeding lessens fertility and on the other hand\nthat an occasional cross with a distinct individual or variety increases\nfertility that I cannot doubt the correctness of this almost universal\nbelief amongst breeders Hybrids are seldom raised by experimentalists in\ngreat numbers and as the parentspecies or other allied hybrids\ngenerally grow in the same garden the visits of insects must be carefully\nprevented during the flowering season: hence hybrids will generally be\nfertilised during each generation by their own individual pollen and I am\nconvinced that this would be injurious to their fertility already lessened\nby their hybrid origin I am strengthened in this conviction by a\nremarkable statement repeatedly made by Grtner namely that if even the\nless fertile hybrids be artificially fertilised with hybrid pollen of the\nsame kind their fertility notwithstanding the frequent ill effects of\nmanipulation sometimes decidedly increases and goes on increasing Now\nin artificial fertilisation pollen is as often taken by chance as I know\nfrom my own experience from the anthers of another flower as from the\nanthers of the flower itself which is to be fertilised so that a cross\nbetween two flowers though probably on the same plant would be thus\neffected Moreover whenever complicated experiments are in progress so\ncareful an observer as Grtner would have castrated his hybrids and this\nwould have insured in each generation a cross with a pollen from a distinct\nflower either from the same plant or from another plant of the same hybrid\nnature And thus the strange fact of the increase of fertility in the\nsuccessive generations of artificially fertilised hybrids may I believe\nbe accounted for by close interbreeding having been avoided\n\nNow let us turn to the results arrived at by the third most experienced\nhybridiser namely the Hon and 250 Rev W Herbert He is as emphatic\nin his conclusion that some hybrids are perfectly fertileas fertile as\nthe pure parentspeciesas are Klreuter and Grtner that some degree of\nsterility between distinct species is a universal law of nature He\nexperimentised on some of the very same species as did Grtner The\ndifference in their results may I think be in part accounted for by\nHerberts great horticultural skill and by his having hothouses at his\ncommand Of his many important statements I will here give only a single\none as an example namely that every ovule in a pod of Crinum capense\nfertilised by C revolutum produced a plant which he says I never saw to\noccur in a case of its natural fecundation So that we here have perfect\nor even more than commonly perfect fertility in a first cross between two\ndistinct species\n\nThis case of the Crinum leads me to refer to a most singular fact namely\nthat there are individual plants of certain species of Lobelia and of some\nother genera which can be far more easily fertilised by the pollen of\nanother and distinct species than by their own pollen and all the\nindividuals of nearly all the species of Hippeastrum seem to be in this\npredicament For these plants have been found to yield seed to the pollen\nof a distinct species though quite sterile with their own pollen\nnotwithstanding that their own pollen was found to be perfectly good for\nit fertilised distinct species So that certain individual plants and all\nthe individuals of certain species can actually be hybridised much more\nreadily than they can be selffertilised For instance a bulb of\nHippeastrum aulicum produced four flowers three were fertilised by Herbert\nwith their own pollen and the fourth was subsequently fertilised by the\npollen of a compound hybrid descended from three other and distinct 251\nspecies: the result was that the ovaries of the three first flowers soon\nceased to grow and after a few days perished entirely whereas the pod\nimpregnated by the pollen of the hybrid made vigorous growth and rapid\nprogress to maturity and bore good seed which vegetated freely In a\nletter to me in 1839 Mr Herbert told me that he had then tried the\nexperiment during five years and he continued to try it during several\nsubsequent years and always with the same result This result has also\nbeen confirmed by other observers in the case of Hippeastrum with its\nsubgenera and in the case of some other genera as Lobelia Passiflora\nand Verbascum Although the plants in these experiments appeared perfectly\nhealthy and although both the ovules and pollen of the same flower were\nperfectly good with respect to other species yet as they were functionally\nimperfect in their mutual selfaction we must infer that the plants were\nin an unnatural state Nevertheless these facts show on what slight and\nmysterious causes the lesser or greater fertility of species when crossed\nin comparison with the same species when selffertilised sometimes\ndepends\n\nThe practical experiments of horticulturists though not made with\nscientific precision deserve some notice It is notorious in how\ncomplicated a manner the species of Pelargonium Fuchsia Calceolaria\nPetunia Rhododendron c have been crossed yet many of these hybrids\nseed freely For instance Herbert asserts that a hybrid from Calceolaria\nintegrifolia and plantaginea species most widely dissimilar in general\nhabit reproduced itself as perfectly as if it had been a natural species\nfrom the mountains of Chile I have taken some pains to ascertain the\ndegree of fertility of some of the complex crosses of Rhododendrons and I\nam assured that many of them 252 are perfectly fertile Mr C Noble for\ninstance informs me that he raises stocks for grafting from a hybrid\nbetween Rhod Ponticum and Catawbiense and that this hybrid seeds as\nfreely as it is possible to imagine Had hybrids when fairly treated\ngone on decreasing in fertility in each successive generation as Grtner\nbelieves to be the case the fact would have been notorious to nurserymen\nHorticulturists raise large beds of the same hybrids and such alone are\nfairly treated for by insect agency the several individuals of the same\nhybrid variety are allowed to freely cross with each other and the\ninjurious influence of close interbreeding is thus prevented Any one may\nreadily convince himself of the efficiency of insectagency by examining\nthe flowers of the more sterile kinds of hybrid rhododendrons which\nproduce no pollen for he will find on their stigmas plenty of pollen\nbrought from other flowers\n\nIn regard to animals much fewer experiments have been carefully tried than\nwith plants If our systematic arrangements can be trusted that is if the\ngenera of animals are as distinct from each other as are the genera of\nplants then we may infer that animals more widely separated in the scale\nof nature can be more easily crossed than in the case of plants but the\nhybrids themselves are I think more sterile I doubt whether any case of\na perfectly fertile hybrid animal can be considered as thoroughly well\nauthenticated It should however be borne in mind that owing to few\nanimals breeding freely under confinement few experiments have been fairly\ntried: for instance the canarybird has been crossed with nine other\nfinches but as not one of these nine species breeds freely in confinement\nwe have no right to expect that the first crosses between them and the\ncanary or that their hybrids 253 should be perfectly fertile Again\nwith respect to the fertility in successive generations of the more fertile\nhybrid animals I hardly know of an instance in which two families of the\nsame hybrid have been raised at the same time from different parents so as\nto avoid the ill effects of close interbreeding On the contrary brothers\nand sisters have usually been crossed in each successive generation in\nopposition to the constantly repeated admonition of every breeder And in\nthis case it is not at all surprising that the inherent sterility in the\nhybrids should have gone on increasing If we were to act thus and pair\nbrothers and sisters in the case of any pure animal which from any cause\nhad the least tendency to sterility the breed would assuredly be lost in a\nvery few generations\n\nAlthough I do not know of any thoroughly wellauthenticated cases of\nperfectly fertile hybrid animals I have some reason to believe that the\nhybrids from Cervulus vaginalis and Reevesii and from Phasianus colchicus\nwith P torquatus and with P versicolor are perfectly fertile There is no\ndoubt that these three pheasants namely the common the true ringnecked\nand the Japan intercross and are becoming blended together in the woods\nof several parts of England The hybrids from the common and Chinese geese\nA cygnoides species which are so different that they are generally\nranked in distinct genera have often bred in this country with either pure\nparent and in one single instance they have bred inter se This was\neffected by Mr Eyton who raised two hybrids from the same parents but\nfrom different hatches and from these two birds he raised no less than\neight hybrids grandchildren of the pure geese from one nest In India\nhowever these crossbred geese must be far more fertile for I am assured\nby two eminently capable judges namely 254 Mr Blyth and Capt Hutton\nthat whole flocks of these crossed geese are kept in various parts of the\ncountry and as they are kept for profit where neither pure parentspecies\nexists they must certainly be highly fertile\n\nA doctrine which originated with Pallas has been largely accepted by\nmodern naturalists namely that most of our domestic animals have\ndescended from two or more wild species since commingled by intercrossing\nOn this view the aboriginal species must either at first have produced\nquite fertile hybrids or the hybrids must have become in subsequent\ngenerations quite fertile under domestication This latter alternative\nseems to me the most probable and I am inclined to believe in its truth\nalthough it rests on no direct evidence I believe for instance that our\ndogs have descended from several wild stocks yet with perhaps the\nexception of certain indigenous domestic dogs of South America all are\nquite fertile together and analogy makes me greatly doubt whether the\nseveral aboriginal species would at first have freely bred together and\nhave produced quite fertile hybrids So again there is reason to believe\nthat our European and the humped Indian cattle are quite fertile together\nbut from facts communicated to me by Mr Blyth I think they must be\nconsidered as distinct species On this view of the origin of many of our\ndomestic animals we must either give up the belief of the almost universal\nsterility of distinct species of animals when crossed or we must look at\nsterility not as an indelible characteristic but as one capable of being\nremoved by domestication\n\nFinally looking to all the ascertained facts on the intercrossing of\nplants and animals it may be concluded that some degree of sterility both\nin first crosses 255 and in hybrids is an extremely general result but\nthat it cannot under our present state of knowledge be considered as\nabsolutely universal\n\n\n\nLaws governing the Sterility of first Crosses and of HybridsWe will\nnow consider a little more in detail the circumstances and rules governing\nthe sterility of first crosses and of hybrids Our chief object will be to\nsee whether or not the rules indicate that species have specially been\nendowed with this quality in order to prevent their crossing and blending\ntogether in utter confusion The following rules and conclusions are\nchiefly drawn up from Grtners admirable work on the hybridisation of\nplants I have taken much pains to ascertain how far the rules apply to\nanimals and considering how scanty our knowledge is in regard to hybrid\nanimals I have been surprised to find how generally the same rules apply\nto both kingdoms\n\nIt has been already remarked that the degree of fertility both of first\ncrosses and of hybrids graduates from zero to perfect fertility It is\nsurprising in how many curious ways this gradation can be shown to exist\nbut only the barest outline of the facts can here be given When pollen\nfrom a plant of one family is placed on the stigma of a plant of a distinct\nfamily it exerts no more influence than so much inorganic dust From this\nabsolute zero of fertility the pollen of different species of the same\ngenus applied to the stigma of some one species yields a perfect gradation\nin the number of seeds produced up to nearly complete or even quite\ncomplete fertility and as we have seen in certain abnormal cases even\nto an excess of fertility beyond that which the plants own pollen will\nproduce So in hybrids themselves there are some which never have\nproduced and probably never would produce even 256 with the pollen of\neither pure parent a single fertile seed: but in some of these cases a\nfirst trace of fertility may be detected by the pollen of one of the pure\nparentspecies causing the flower of the hybrid to wither earlier than it\notherwise would have done and the early withering of the flower is well\nknown to be a sign of incipient fertilisation From this extreme degree of\nsterility we have selffertilised hybrids producing a greater and greater\nnumber of seeds up to perfect fertility\n\nHybrids from two species which are very difficult to cross and which\nrarely produce any offspring are generally very sterile but the\nparallelism between the difficulty of making a first cross and the\nsterility of the hybrids thus producedtwo classes of facts which are\ngenerally confounded togetheris by no means strict There are many cases\nin which two pure species can be united with unusual facility and produce\nnumerous hybridoffspring yet these hybrids are remarkably sterile On the\nother hand there are species which can be crossed very rarely or with\nextreme difficulty but the hybrids when at last produced are very\nfertile Even within the limits of the same genus for instance in\nDianthus these two opposite cases occur\n\nThe fertility both of first crosses and of hybrids is more easily\naffected by unfavourable conditions than is the fertility of pure species\nBut the degree of fertility is likewise innately variable for it is not\nalways the same when the same two species are crossed under the same\ncircumstances but depends in part upon the constitution of the individuals\nwhich happen to have been chosen for the experiment So it is with hybrids\nfor their degree of fertility is often found to differ greatly in the\nseveral individuals raised from seed out of the same capsule and exposed to\nexactly the same conditions 257\n\nBy the term systematic affinity is meant the resemblance between species\nin structure and in constitution more especially in the structure of parts\nwhich are of high physiological importance and which differ little in the\nallied species Now the fertility of first crosses between species and of\nthe hybrids produced from them is largely governed by their systematic\naffinity This is clearly shown by hybrids never having been raised between\nspecies ranked by systematists in distinct families and on the other hand\nby very closely allied species generally uniting with facility But the\ncorrespondence between systematic affinity and the facility of crossing is\nby no means strict A multitude of cases could be given of very closely\nallied species which will not unite or only with extreme difficulty and\non the other hand of very distinct species which unite with the utmost\nfacility In the same family there may be a genus as Dianthus in which\nvery many species can most readily be crossed and another genus as\nSilene in which the most persevering efforts have failed to produce\nbetween extremely close species a single hybrid Even within the limits of\nthe same genus we meet with this same difference for instance the many\nspecies of Nicotiana have been more largely crossed than the species of\nalmost any other genus but Grtner found that N acuminata which is not a\nparticularly distinct species obstinately failed to fertilise or to be\nfertilised by no less than eight other species of Nicotiana Very many\nanalogous facts could be given\n\nNo one has been able to point out what kind or what amount of difference\nin any recognisable character is sufficient to prevent two species\ncrossing It can be shown that plants most widely different in habit and\ngeneral appearance and having strongly marked 258 differences in every\npart of the flower even in the pollen in the fruit and in the\ncotyledons can be crossed Annual and perennial plants deciduous and\nevergreen trees plants inhabiting different stations and fitted for\nextremely different climates can often be crossed with ease\n\nBy a reciprocal cross between two species I mean the case for instance\nof a stallionhorse being first crossed with a femaleass and then a\nmaleass with a mare: these two species may then be said to have been\nreciprocally crossed There is often the widest possible difference in the\nfacility of making reciprocal crosses Such cases are highly important for\nthey prove that the capacity in any two species to cross is often\ncompletely independent of their systematic affinity or of any recognisable\ndifference in their whole organisation On the other hand these cases\nclearly show that the capacity for crossing is connected with\nconstitutional differences imperceptible by us and confined to the\nreproductive system This difference in the result of reciprocal crosses\nbetween the same two species was long ago observed by Klreuter To give an\ninstance: Mirabilis jalapa can easily be fertilised by the pollen of M\nlongiflora and the hybrids thus produced are sufficiently fertile but\nKlreuter tried more than two hundred times during eight following years\nto fertilise reciprocally M longiflora with the pollen of M jalapa and\nutterly failed Several other equally striking cases could be given Thuret\nhas observed the same fact with certain seaweeds or Fuci Grtner\nmoreover found that this difference of facility in making reciprocal\ncrosses is extremely common in a lesser degree He has observed it even\nbetween forms so closely related as Matthiola annua and glabra that many\nbotanists rank them only as varieties It is also a remarkable fact that\nhybrids raised from reciprocal crosses though 259 of course compounded\nof the very same two species the one species having first been used as the\nfather and then as the mother generally differ in fertility in a small\nand occasionally in a high degree\n\nSeveral other singular rules could be given from Grtner: for instance\nsome species have a remarkable power of crossing with other species other\nspecies of the same genus have a remarkable power of impressing their\nlikeness on their hybrid offspring but these two powers do not at all\nnecessarily go together There are certain hybrids which instead of having\nas is usual an intermediate character between their two parents always\nclosely resemble one of them and such hybrids though externally so like\none of their pure parentspecies are with rare exceptions extremely\nsterile So again amongst hybrids which are usually intermediate in\nstructure between their parents exceptional and abnormal individuals\nsometimes are born which closely resemble one of their pure parents and\nthese hybrids are almost always utterly sterile even when the other\nhybrids raised from seed from the same capsule have a considerable degree\nof fertility These facts show how completely fertility in the hybrid is\nindependent of its external resemblance to either pure parent\n\nConsidering the several rules now given which govern the fertility of\nfirst crosses and of hybrids we see that when forms which must be\nconsidered as good and distinct species are united their fertility\ngraduates from zero to perfect fertility or even to fertility under\ncertain conditions in excess That their fertility besides being eminently\nsusceptible to favourable and unfavourable conditions is innately\nvariable That it is by no means always the same in degree in the first\ncross and in the hybrids produced 260 from this cross That the fertility\nof hybrids is not related to the degree in which they resemble in external\nappearance either parent And lastly that the facility of making a first\ncross between any two species is not always governed by their systematic\naffinity or degree of resemblance to each other This latter statement is\nclearly proved by reciprocal crosses between the same two species for\naccording as the one species or the other is used as the father or the\nmother there is generally some difference and occasionally the widest\npossible difference in the facility of effecting an union The hybrids\nmoreover produced from reciprocal crosses often differ in fertility\n\nNow do these complex and singular rules indicate that species have been\nendowed with sterility simply to prevent their becoming confounded in\nnature I think not For why should the sterility be so extremely different\nin degree when various species are crossed all of which we must suppose\nit would be equally important to keep from blending together Why should\nthe degree of sterility be innately variable in the individuals of the same\nspecies Why should some species cross with facility and yet produce very\nsterile hybrids and other species cross with extreme difficulty and yet\nproduce fairly fertile hybrids Why should there often be so great a\ndifference in the result of a reciprocal cross between the same two\nspecies Why it may even be asked has the production of hybrids been\npermitted to grant to species the special power of producing hybrids and\nthen to stop their further propagation by different degrees of sterility\nnot strictly related to the facility of the first union between their\nparents seems to be a strange arrangement\n\nThe foregoing rules and facts on the other hand 261 appear to me\nclearly to indicate that the sterility both of first crosses and of hybrids\nis simply incidental or dependent on unknown differences chiefly in the\nreproductive systems of the species which are crossed The differences\nbeing of so peculiar and limited a nature that in reciprocal crosses\nbetween two species the male sexual element of the one will often freely\nact on the female sexual element of the other but not in a reversed\ndirection It will be advisable to explain a little more fully by an\nexample what I mean by sterility being incidental on other differences and\nnot a specially endowed quality As the capacity of one plant to be grafted\nor budded on another is so entirely unimportant for its welfare in a state\nof nature I presume that no one will suppose that this capacity is a\nspecially endowed quality but will admit that it is incidental on\ndifferences in the laws of growth of the two plants We can sometimes see\nthe reason why one tree will not take on another from differences in their\nrate of growth in the hardness of their wood in the period of the flow or\nnature of their sap c but in a multitude of cases we can assign no\nreason whatever Great diversity in the size of two plants one being woody\nand the other herbaceous one being evergreen and the other deciduous and\nadaptation to widely different climates does not always prevent the two\ngrafting together As in hybridisation so with grafting the capacity is\nlimited by systematic affinity for no one has been able to graft trees\ntogether belonging to quite distinct families and on the other hand\nclosely allied species and varieties of the same species can usually but\nnot invariably be grafted with ease But this capacity as in\nhybridisation is by no means absolutely governed by systematic affinity\nAlthough many distinct genera within the same family have been grafted\n262 together in other cases species of the same genus will not take on\neach other The pear can be grafted far more readily on the quince which\nis ranked as a distinct genus than on the apple which is a member of the\nsame genus Even different varieties of the pear take with different\ndegrees of facility on the quince so do different varieties of the apricot\nand peach on certain varieties of the plum\n\nAs Grtner found that there was sometimes an innate difference in different\nindividuals of the same two species in crossing so Sagaret believes this\nto be the case with different individuals of the same two species in being\ngrafted together As in reciprocal crosses the facility of effecting an\nunion is often very far from equal so it sometimes is in grafting the\ncommon gooseberry for instance cannot be grafted on the currant whereas\nthe currant will take though with difficulty on the gooseberry\n\nWe have seen that the sterility of hybrids which have their reproductive\norgans in an imperfect condition is a very different case from the\ndifficulty of uniting two pure species which have their reproductive\norgans perfect yet these two distinct cases run to a certain extent\nparallel Something analogous occurs in grafting for Thouin found that\nthree species of Robinia which seeded freely on their own roots and which\ncould be grafted with no great difficulty on another species when thus\ngrafted were rendered barren On the other hand certain species of Sorbus\nwhen grafted on other species yielded twice as much fruit as when on their\nown roots We are reminded by this latter fact of the extraordinary case of\nHippeastrum Lobelia c which seeded much more freely when fertilised\nwith the pollen of distinct species than when selffertilised with their\nown pollen 263\n\nWe thus see that although there is a clear and fundamental difference\nbetween the mere adhesion of grafted stocks and the union of the male and\nfemale elements in the act of reproduction yet that there is a rude degree\nof parallelism in the results of grafting and of crossing distinct species\nAnd as we must look at the curious and complex laws governing the facility\nwith which trees can be grafted on each other as incidental on unknown\ndifferences in their vegetative systems so I believe that the still more\ncomplex laws governing the facility of first crosses are incidental on\nunknown differences chiefly in their reproductive systems These\ndifferences in both cases follow to a certain extent as might have been\nexpected systematic affinity by which every kind of resemblance and\ndissimilarity between organic beings is attempted to be expressed The\nfacts by no means seem to me to indicate that the greater or lesser\ndifficulty of either grafting or crossing together various species has been\na special endowment although in the case of crossing the difficulty is as\nimportant for the endurance and stability of specific forms as in the case\nof grafting it is unimportant for their welfare\n\n\n\nCauses of the Sterility of first Crosses and of HybridsWe may now look\na little closer at the probable causes of the sterility of first crosses\nand of hybrids These two cases are fundamentally different for as just\nremarked in the union of two pure species the male and female sexual\nelements are perfect whereas in hybrids they are imperfect Even in first\ncrosses the greater or lesser difficulty in effecting a union apparently\ndepends on several distinct causes There must sometimes be a physical\nimpossibility in the male element reaching the ovule as would be the case\nwith a plant 264 having a pistil too long for the pollentubes to reach\nthe ovarium It has also been observed that when pollen of one species is\nplaced on the stigma of a distantly allied species though the pollentubes\nprotrude they do not penetrate the stigmatic surface Again the male\nelement may reach the female element but be incapable of causing an embryo\nto be developed as seems to have been the case with some of Thurets\nexperiments on Fuci No explanation can be given of these facts any more\nthan why certain trees cannot be grafted on others Lastly an embryo may\nbe developed and then perish at an early period This latter alternative\nhas not been sufficiently attended to but I believe from observations\ncommunicated to me by Mr Hewitt who has had great experience in\nhybridising gallinaceous birds that the early death of the embryo is a\nvery frequent cause of sterility in first crosses I was at first very\nunwilling to believe in this view as hybrids when once born are\ngenerally healthy and longlived as we see in the case of the common mule\nHybrids however are differently circumstanced before and after birth:\nwhen born and living in a country where their two parents can live they\nare generally placed under suitable conditions of life But a hybrid\npartakes of only half of the nature and constitution of its mother and\ntherefore before birth as long as it is nourished within its mothers womb\nor within the egg or seed produced by the mother it may be exposed to\nconditions in some degree unsuitable and consequently be liable to perish\nat an early period more especially as all very young beings seem eminently\nsensitive to injurious or unnatural conditions of life\n\nIn regard to the sterility of hybrids in which the sexual elements are\nimperfectly developed the case is 265 very different I have more than\nonce alluded to a large body of facts which I have collected showing that\nwhen animals and plants are removed from their natural conditions they are\nextremely liable to have their reproductive systems seriously affected\nThis in fact is the great bar to the domestication of animals Between\nthe sterility thus superinduced and that of hybrids there are many points\nof similarity In both cases the sterility is independent of general\nhealth and is often accompanied by excess of size or great luxuriance In\nboth cases the sterility occurs in various degrees in both the male\nelement is the most liable to be affected but sometimes the female more\nthan the male In both the tendency goes to a certain extent with\nsystematic affinity for whole groups of animals and plants are rendered\nimpotent by the same unnatural conditions and whole groups of species tend\nto produce sterile hybrids On the other hand one species in a group will\nsometimes resist great changes of conditions with unimpaired fertility and\ncertain species in a group will produce unusually fertile hybrids No one\ncan tell till he tries whether any particular animal will breed under\nconfinement or any exotic plant seed freely under culture nor can he tell\ntill he tries whether any two species of a genus will produce more or less\nsterile hybrids Lastly when organic beings are placed during several\ngenerations under conditions not natural to them they are extremely liable\nto vary which is due as I believe to their reproductive systems having\nbeen specially affected though in a lesser degree than when sterility\nensues So it is with hybrids for hybrids in successive generations are\neminently liable to vary as every experimentalist has observed\n\nThus we see that when organic beings are placed under new and unnatural\nconditions and when hybrids 266 are produced by the unnatural crossing\nof two species the reproductive system independently of the general state\nof health is affected by sterility in a very similar manner In the one\ncase the conditions of life have been disturbed though often in so slight\na degree as to be inappreciable by us in the other case or that of\nhybrids the external conditions have remained the same but the\norganisation has been disturbed by two different structures and\nconstitutions having been blended into one For it is scarcely possible\nthat two organisations should be compounded into one without some\ndisturbance occurring in the development or periodical action or mutual\nrelation of the different parts and organs one to another or to the\nconditions of life When hybrids are able to breed inter se they\ntransmit to their offspring from generation to generation the same\ncompounded organisation and hence we need not be surprised that their\nsterility though in some degree variable rarely diminishes\n\nIt must however be confessed that we cannot understand excepting on\nvague hypotheses several facts with respect to the sterility of hybrids\nfor instance the unequal fertility of hybrids produced from reciprocal\ncrosses or the increased sterility in those hybrids which occasionally and\nexceptionally resemble closely either pure parent Nor do I pretend that\nthe foregoing remarks go to the root of the matter: no explanation is\noffered why an organism when placed under unnatural conditions is\nrendered sterile All that I have attempted to show is that in two cases\nin some respects allied sterility is the common resultin the one case\nfrom the conditions of life having been disturbed in the other case from\nthe organisation having been disturbed by two organisations having been\ncompounded into one\n\nIt may seem fanciful but I suspect that a similar 267 parallelism\nextends to an allied yet very different class of facts It is an old and\nalmost universal belief founded I think on a considerable body of\nevidence that slight changes in the conditions of life are beneficial to\nall living things We see this acted on by farmers and gardeners in their\nfrequent exchanges of seed tubers c from one soil or climate to\nanother and back again During the convalescence of animals we plainly\nsee that great benefit is derived from almost any change in the habits of\nlife Again both with plants and animals there is abundant evidence that\na cross between very distinct individuals of the same species that is\nbetween members of different strains or subbreeds gives vigour and\nfertility to the offspring I believe indeed from the facts alluded to in\nour fourth chapter that a certain amount of crossing is indispensable even\nwith hermaphrodites and that close interbreeding continued during several\ngenerations between the nearest relations especially if these be kept\nunder the same conditions of life always induces weakness and sterility in\nthe progeny\n\nHence it seems that on the one hand slight changes in the conditions of\nlife benefit all organic beings and on the other hand that slight\ncrosses that is crosses between the males and females of the same species\nwhich have varied and become slightly different give vigour and fertility\nto the offspring But we have seen that greater changes or changes of a\nparticular nature often render organic beings in some degree sterile and\nthat greater crosses that is crosses between males and females which have\nbecome widely or specifically different produce hybrids which are\ngenerally sterile in some degree I cannot persuade myself that this\nparallelism is an accident or an illusion Both series of facts seem to be\nconnected together by some 268 common but unknown bond which is\nessentially related to the principle of life\n\n\n\nFertility of Varieties when crossed and of their Mongrel offspringIt\nmay be urged as a most forcible argument that there must be some\nessential distinction between species and varieties and that there must be\nsome error in all the foregoing remarks inasmuch as varieties however\nmuch they may differ from each other in external appearance cross with\nperfect facility and yield perfectly fertile offspring I fully admit that\nthis is almost invariably the case But if we look to varieties produced\nunder nature we are immediately involved in hopeless difficulties for if\ntwo hitherto reputed varieties be found in any degree sterile together\nthey are at once ranked by most naturalists as species For instance the\nblue and red pimpernel the primrose and cowslip which are considered by\nmany of our best botanists as varieties are said by Grtner not to be\nquite fertile when crossed and he consequently ranks them as undoubted\nspecies If we thus argue in a circle the fertility of all varieties\nproduced under nature will assuredly have to be granted\n\nIf we turn to varieties produced or supposed to have been produced under\ndomestication we are still involved in doubt For when it is stated for\ninstance that the German Spitz dog unites more easily than other dogs with\nfoxes or that certain South American indigenous domestic dogs do not\nreadily cross with European dogs the explanation which will occur to every\none and probably the true one is that these dogs have descended from\nseveral aboriginally distinct species Nevertheless the perfect fertility\nof so many domestic varieties differing widely from each other in\nappearance for instance of the pigeon or of the cabbage is 269 a\nremarkable fact more especially when we reflect how many species there\nare which though resembling each other most closely are utterly sterile\nwhen intercrossed Several considerations however render the fertility of\ndomestic varieties less remarkable than at first appears It can in the\nfirst place be clearly shown that mere external dissimilarity between two\nspecies does not determine their greater or lesser degree of sterility when\ncrossed and we may apply the same rule to domestic varieties In the\nsecond place some eminent naturalists believe that a long course of\ndomestication tends to eliminate sterility in the successive generations of\nhybrids which were at first only slightly sterile and if this be so we\nsurely ought not to expect to find sterility both appearing and\ndisappearing under nearly the same conditions of life Lastly and this\nseems to me by far the most important consideration new races of animals\nand plants are produced under domestication by mans methodical and\nunconscious power of selection for his own use and pleasure: he neither\nwishes to select nor could select slight differences in the reproductive\nsystem or other constitutional differences correlated with the\nreproductive system He supplies his several varieties with the same food\ntreats them in nearly the same manner and does not wish to alter their\ngeneral habits of life Nature acts uniformly and slowly during vast\nperiods of time on the whole organisation in any way which may be for each\ncreatures own good and thus she may either directly or more probably\nindirectly through correlation modify the reproductive system in the\nseveral descendants from any one species Seeing this difference in the\nprocess of selection as carried on by man and nature we need not be\nsurprised at some difference in the result\n\nI have as yet spoken as if the varieties of the same 270 species were\ninvariably fertile when intercrossed But it seems to me impossible to\nresist the evidence of the existence of a certain amount of sterility in\nthe few following cases which I will briefly abstract The evidence is at\nleast as good as that from which we believe in the sterility of a multitude\nof species The evidence is also derived from hostile witnesses who in\nall other cases consider fertility and sterility as safe criterions of\nspecific distinction Grtner kept during several years a dwarf kind of\nmaize with yellow seeds and a tall variety with red seeds growing near\neach other in his garden and although these plants have separated sexes\nthey never naturally crossed He then fertilised thirteen flowers of the\none with the pollen of the other but only a single head produced any seed\nand this one head produced only five grains Manipulation in this case\ncould not have been injurious as the plants have separated sexes No one\nI believe has suspected that these varieties of maize are distinct\nspecies and it is important to notice that the hybrid plants thus raised\nwere themselves perfectly fertile so that even Grtner did not venture\nto consider the two varieties as specifically distinct\n\nGirou de Buzareingues crossed three varieties of gourd which like the\nmaize has separated sexes and he asserts that their mutual fertilisation\nis by so much the less easy as their differences are greater How far these\nexperiments may be trusted I know not but the forms experimentised on\nare ranked by Sagaret who mainly founds his classification by the test of\ninfertility as varieties\n\nThe following case is far more remarkable and seems at first quite\nincredible but it is the result of an astonishing number of experiments\nmade during many years on nine species of Verbascum by so good an observer\n271 and so hostile a witness as Grtner: namely that yellow and white\nvarieties of the same species of Verbascum when intercrossed produce less\nseed than do either coloured varieties when fertilised with pollen from\ntheir own coloured flowers Moreover he asserts that when yellow and white\nvarieties of one species are crossed with yellow and white varieties of a\ndistinct species more seed is produced by the crosses between the\nsimilarly coloured flowers than between those which are differently\ncoloured Yet these varieties of Verbascum present no other difference\nbesides the mere colour of the flower and one variety can sometimes be\nraised from the seed of the other\n\nFrom observations which I have made on certain varieties of hollyhock I am\ninclined to suspect that they present analogous facts\n\nKlreuter whose accuracy has been confirmed by every subsequent observer\nhas proved the remarkable fact that one variety of the common tobacco is\nmore fertile when crossed with a widely distinct species than are the\nother varieties He experimentised on five forms which are commonly\nreputed to be varieties and which he tested by the severest trial namely\nby reciprocal crosses and he found their mongrel offspring perfectly\nfertile But one of these five varieties when used either as father or\nmother and crossed with the Nicotiana glutinosa always yielded hybrids\nnot so sterile as those which were produced from the four other varieties\nwhen crossed with N glutinosa Hence the reproductive system of this one\nvariety must have been in some manner and in some degree modified\n\nFrom these facts from the great difficulty of ascertaining the infertility\nof varieties in a state of nature for a supposed variety if infertile in\nany degree would generally be ranked as species from man selecting only\n272 external characters in the production of the most distinct domestic\nvarieties and from not wishing or being able to produce recondite and\nfunctional differences in the reproductive system from these several\nconsiderations and facts I do not think that the very general fertility of\nvarieties can be proved to be of universal occurrence or to form a\nfundamental distinction between varieties and species The general\nfertility of varieties does not seem to me sufficient to overthrow the view\nwhich I have taken with respect to the very general but not invariable\nsterility of first crosses and of hybrids namely that it is not a special\nendowment but is incidental on slowly acquired modifications more\nespecially in the reproductive systems of the forms which are crossed\n\n\n\nHybrids and Mongrels compared independently of their\nfertilityIndependently of the question of fertility the offspring of\nspecies when crossed and of varieties when crossed may be compared in\nseveral other respects Grtner whose strong wish was to draw a marked\nline of distinction between species and varieties could find very few and\nas it seems to me quite unimportant differences between the socalled\nhybrid offspring of species and the socalled mongrel offspring of\nvarieties And on the other hand they agree most closely in very many\nimportant respects\n\nI shall here discuss this subject with extreme brevity The most important\ndistinction is that in the first generation mongrels are more variable\nthan hybrids but Grtner admits that hybrids from species which have long\nbeen cultivated are often variable in the first generation and I have\nmyself seen striking instances of this fact Grtner further admits that\nhybrids between very closely allied species are more variable 273 than\nthose from very distinct species and this shows that the difference in the\ndegree of variability graduates away When mongrels and the more fertile\nhybrids are propagated for several generations an extreme amount of\nvariability in their offspring is notorious but some few cases both of\nhybrids and mongrels long retaining uniformity of character could be given\nThe variability however in the successive generations of mongrels is\nperhaps greater than in hybrids\n\nThis greater variability of mongrels than of hybrids does not seem to me at\nall surprising For the parents of mongrels are varieties and mostly\ndomestic varieties very few experiments having been tried on natural\nvarieties and this implies in most cases that there has been recent\nvariability and therefore we might expect that such variability would\noften continue and be superadded to that arising from the mere act of\ncrossing The slight degree of variability in hybrids from the first cross\nor in the first generation in contrast with their extreme variability in\nthe succeeding generations is a curious fact and deserves attention For\nit bears on and corroborates the view which I have taken on the cause of\nordinary variability namely that it is due to the reproductive system\nbeing eminently sensitive to any change in the conditions of life being\nthus often rendered either impotent or at least incapable of its proper\nfunction of producing offspring identical with the parentform Now hybrids\nin the first generation are descended from species excluding those long\ncultivated which have not had their reproductive systems in any way\naffected and they are not variable but hybrids themselves have their\nreproductive systems seriously affected and their descendants are highly\nvariable\n\nBut to return to our comparison of mongrels and 274 hybrids: Grtner\nstates that mongrels are more liable than hybrids to revert to either\nparentform but this if it be true is certainly only a difference in\ndegree Grtner further insists that when any two species although most\nclosely allied to each other are crossed with a third species the hybrids\nare widely different from each other whereas if two very distinct\nvarieties of one species are crossed with another species the hybrids do\nnot differ much But this conclusion as far as I can make out is founded\non a single experiment and seems directly opposed to the results of\nseveral experiments made by Klreuter\n\nThese alone are the unimportant differences which Grtner is able to point\nout between hybrid and mongrel plants On the other hand the resemblance\nin mongrels and in hybrids to their respective parents more especially in\nhybrids produced from nearly related species follows according to Grtner\nthe same laws When two species are crossed one has sometimes a prepotent\npower of impressing its likeness on the hybrid and so I believe it to be\nwith varieties of plants With animals one variety certainly often has this\nprepotent power over another variety Hybrid plants produced from a\nreciprocal cross generally resemble each other closely and so it is with\nmongrels from a reciprocal cross Both hybrids and mongrels can be reduced\nto either pure parentform by repeated crosses in successive generations\nwith either parent\n\nThese several remarks are apparently applicable to animals but the subject\nis here excessively complicated partly owing to the existence of secondary\nsexual characters but more especially owing to prepotency in transmitting\nlikeness running more strongly in one sex than in the other both when one\nspecies is crossed with another and when one variety is crossed with\n275 another variety For instance I think those authors are right who\nmaintain that the ass has a prepotent power over the horse so that both\nthe mule and the hinny more resemble the ass than the horse but that the\nprepotency runs more strongly in the maleass than in the female so that\nthe mule which is the offspring of the maleass and mare is more like an\nass than is the hinny which is the offspring of the femaleass and\nstallion\n\nMuch stress has been laid by some authors on the supposed fact that\nmongrel animals alone are born closely like one of their parents but it\ncan be shown that this does sometimes occur with hybrids yet I grant much\nless frequently with hybrids than with mongrels Looking to the cases which\nI have collected of crossbred animals closely resembling one parent the\nresemblances seem chiefly confined to characters almost monstrous in their\nnature and which have suddenly appearedsuch as albinism melanism\ndeficiency of tail or horns or additional fingers and toes and do not\nrelate to characters which have been slowly acquired by selection\nConsequently sudden reversions to the perfect character of either parent\nwould be more likely to occur with mongrels which are descended from\nvarieties often suddenly produced and semimonstrous in character than\nwith hybrids which are descended from species slowly and naturally\nproduced On the whole I entirely agree with Dr Prosper Lucas who after\narranging an enormous body of facts with respect to animals comes to the\nconclusion that the laws of resemblance of the child to its parents are\nthe same whether the two parents differ much or little from each other\nnamely in the union of individuals of the same variety or of different\nvarieties or of distinct species\n\nLaying aside the question of fertility and sterility 276 in all other\nrespects there seems to be a general and close similarity in the offspring\nof crossed species and of crossed varieties If we look at species as\nhaving been specially created and at varieties as having been produced by\nsecondary laws this similarity would be an astonishing fact But it\nharmonises perfectly with the view that there is no essential distinction\nbetween species and varieties\n\n\n\nSummary of ChapterFirst crosses between forms sufficiently distinct to\nbe ranked as species and their hybrids are very generally but not\nuniversally sterile The sterility is of all degrees and is often so\nslight that the two most careful experimentalists who have ever lived have\ncome to diametrically opposite conclusions in ranking forms by this test\nThe sterility is innately variable in individuals of the same species and\nis eminently susceptible of favourable and unfavourable conditions The\ndegree of sterility does not strictly follow systematic affinity but is\ngoverned by several curious and complex laws It is generally different\nand sometimes widely different in reciprocal crosses between the same two\nspecies It is not always equal in degree in a first cross and in the\nhybrid produced from this cross\n\nIn the same manner as in grafting trees the capacity of one species or\nvariety to take on another is incidental on generally unknown differences\nin their vegetative systems so in crossing the greater or less facility\nof one species to unite with another is incidental on unknown differences\nin their reproductive systems There is no more reason to think that\nspecies have been specially endowed with various degrees of sterility to\nprevent them crossing and blending in nature than to think that trees have\nbeen specially endowed with various and 277 somewhat analogous degrees of\ndifficulty in being grafted together in order to prevent them becoming\ninarched in our forests\n\nThe sterility of first crosses between pure species which have their\nreproductive systems perfect seems to depend on several circumstances in\nsome cases largely on the early death of the embryo The sterility of\nhybrids which have their reproductive systems imperfect and which have\nhad this system and their whole organisation disturbed by being compounded\nof two distinct species seems closely allied to that sterility which so\nfrequently affects pure species when their natural conditions of life have\nbeen disturbed This view is supported by a parallelism of another\nkindnamely that the crossing of forms only slightly different is\nfavourable to the vigour and fertility of their offspring and that slight\nchanges in the conditions of life are apparently favourable to the vigour\nand fertility of all organic beings It is not surprising that the degree\nof difficulty in uniting two species and the degree of sterility of their\nhybridoffspring should generally correspond though due to distinct\ncauses for both depend on the amount of difference of some kind between\nthe species which are crossed Nor is it surprising that the facility of\neffecting a first cross the fertility of the hybrids produced from it and\nthe capacity of being grafted togetherthough this latter capacity\nevidently depends on widely different circumstancesshould all run to a\ncertain extent parallel with the systematic affinity of the forms which\nare subjected to experiment for systematic affinity attempts to express\nall kinds of resemblance between all species\n\nFirst crosses between forms known to be varieties or sufficiently alike to\nbe considered as varieties and their mongrel offspring are very\ngenerally but not quite 278 universally fertile Nor is this nearly\ngeneral and perfect fertility surprising when we remember how liable we\nare to argue in a circle with respect to varieties in a state of nature\nand when we remember that the greater number of varieties have been\nproduced under domestication by the selection of mere external differences\nand not of differences in the reproductive system In all other respects\nexcluding fertility there is a close general resemblance between hybrids\nand mongrels Finally then the facts briefly given in this chapter do not\nseem to me opposed to but even rather to support the view that there is\nno fundamental distinction between species and varieties\n\n                                   \n\n\n279\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nON THE IMPERFECTION OF THE GEOLOGICAL RECORD\n\n    On the absence of intermediate varieties at the present dayOn the\n    nature of extinct intermediate varieties on their numberOn the vast\n    lapse of time as inferred from the rate of deposition and of\n    denudationOn the poorness of our palontological collectionsOn the\n    intermittence of geological formationsOn the absence of intermediate\n    varieties in any one formationOn the sudden appearance of groups of\n    speciesOn their sudden appearance in the lowest known fossiliferous\n    strata\n\nIn the sixth chapter I enumerated the chief objections which might be\njustly urged against the views maintained in this volume Most of them have\nnow been discussed One namely the distinctness of specific forms and\ntheir not being blended together by innumerable transitional links is a\nvery obvious difficulty I assigned reasons why such links do not commonly\noccur at the present day under the circumstances apparently most\nfavourable for their presence namely on an extensive and continuous area\nwith graduated physical conditions I endeavoured to show that the life of\neach species depends in a more important manner on the presence of other\nalready defined organic forms than on climate and therefore that the\nreally governing conditions of life do not graduate away quite insensibly\nlike heat or moisture I endeavoured also to show that intermediate\nvarieties from existing in lesser numbers than the forms which they\nconnect will generally be beaten out and exterminated during the course of\nfurther modification and improvement The main cause however of\ninnumerable intermediate links not now occurring everywhere throughout\nnature 280 depends on the very process of natural selection through\nwhich new varieties continually take the places of and exterminate their\nparentforms But just in proportion as this process of extermination has\nacted on an enormous scale so must the number of intermediate varieties\nwhich have formerly existed on the earth be truly enormous Why then is\nnot every geological formation and every stratum full of such intermediate\nlinks Geology assuredly does not reveal any such finely graduated organic\nchain and this perhaps is the most obvious and gravest objection which\ncan be urged against my theory The explanation lies as I believe in the\nextreme imperfection of the geological record\n\nIn the first place it should always be borne in mind what sort of\nintermediate forms must on my theory have formerly existed I have found\nit difficult when looking at any two species to avoid picturing to\nmyself forms directly intermediate between them But this is a wholly\nfalse view we should always look for forms intermediate between each\nspecies and a common but unknown progenitor and the progenitor will\ngenerally have differed in some respects from all its modified descendants\nTo give a simple illustration: the fantail and pouter pigeons have both\ndescended from the rockpigeon if we possessed all the intermediate\nvarieties which have ever existed we should have an extremely close series\nbetween both and the rockpigeon but we should have no varieties directly\nintermediate between the fantail and pouter none for instance combining\na tail somewhat expanded with a crop somewhat enlarged the characteristic\nfeatures of these two breeds These two breeds moreover have become so\nmuch modified that if we had no historical or indirect evidence regarding\ntheir origin it would not have been possible to have 281 determined from\na mere comparison of their structure with that of the rockpigeon whether\nthey had descended from this species or from some other allied species\nsuch as C oenas\n\nSo with natural species if we look to forms very distinct for instance to\nthe horse and tapir we have no reason to suppose that links ever existed\ndirectly intermediate between them but between each and an unknown common\nparent The common parent will have had in its whole organisation much\ngeneral resemblance to the tapir and to the horse but in some points of\nstructure may have differed considerably from both even perhaps more than\nthey differ from each other Hence in all such cases we should be unable\nto recognise the parentform of any two or more species even if we closely\ncompared the structure of the parent with that of its modified descendants\nunless at the same time we had a nearly perfect chain of the intermediate\nlinks\n\nIt is just possible by my theory that one of two living forms might have\ndescended from the other for instance a horse from a tapir and in this\ncase direct intermediate links will have existed between them But such a\ncase would imply that one form had remained for a very long period\nunaltered whilst its descendants had undergone a vast amount of change\nand the principle of competition between organism and organism between\nchild and parent will render this a very rare event for in all cases the\nnew and improved forms of life tend to supplant the old and unimproved\nforms\n\nBy the theory of natural selection all living species have been connected\nwith the parentspecies of each genus by differences not greater than we\nsee between the varieties of the same species at the present 282 day and\nthese parentspecies now generally extinct have in their turn been\nsimilarly connected with more ancient species and so on backwards always\nconverging to the common ancestor of each great class So that the number\nof intermediate and transitional links between all living and extinct\nspecies must have been inconceivably great But assuredly if this theory\nbe true such have lived upon this earth\n\n\n\nOn the lapse of TimeIndependently of our not finding fossil remains of\nsuch infinitely numerous connecting links it may be objected that time\nwill not have sufficed for so great an amount of organic change all\nchanges having been effected very slowly through natural selection It is\nhardly possible for me even to recall to the reader who may not be a\npractical geologist the facts leading the mind feebly to comprehend the\nlapse of time He who can read Sir Charles Lyells grand work on the\nPrinciples of Geology which the future historian will recognise as having\nproduced a revolution in natural science yet does not admit how\nincomprehensively vast have been the past periods of time may at once\nclose this volume Not that it suffices to study the Principles of Geology\nor to read special treatises by different observers on separate formations\nand to mark how each author attempts to give an inadequate idea of the\nduration of each formation or even each stratum A man must for years\nexamine for himself great piles of superimposed strata and watch the sea\nat work grinding down old rocks and making fresh sediment before he can\nhope to comprehend anything of the lapse of time the monuments of which we\nsee around us\n\nIt is good to wander along lines of seacoast when formed of moderately\nhard rocks and mark the 283 process of degradation The tides in most\ncases reach the cliffs only for a short time twice a day and the waves eat\ninto them only when they are charged with sand or pebbles for there is\ngood evidence that pure water can effect little or nothing in wearing away\nrock At last the base of the cliff is undermined huge fragments fall\ndown and these remaining fixed have to be worn away atom by atom until\nreduced in size they can be rolled about by the waves and then are more\nquickly ground into pebbles sand or mud But how often do we see along\nthe bases of retreating cliffs rounded boulders all thickly clothed by\nmarine productions showing how little they are abraded and how seldom they\nare rolled about Moreover if we follow for a few miles any line of rocky\ncliff which is undergoing degradation we find that it is only here and\nthere along a short length or round a promontory that the cliffs are at\nthe present time suffering The appearance of the surface and the\nvegetation show that elsewhere years have elapsed since the waters washed\ntheir base\n\nHe who most closely studies the action of the sea on our shores will I\nbelieve be most deeply impressed with the slowness with which rocky coasts\nare worn away The observations on this head by Hugh Miller and by that\nexcellent observer Mr Smith of Jordan Hill are most impressive With the\nmind thus impressed let any one examine beds of conglomerate many thousand\nfeet in thickness which though probably formed at a quicker rate than\nmany other deposits yet from being formed of worn and rounded pebbles\neach of which bears the stamp of time are good to show how slowly the mass\nhas been accumulated In the Cordillera I estimated one pile of\nconglomerate at ten thousand feet in thickness Let the 284 observer\nremember Lyells profound remark that the thickness and extent of\nsedimentary formations are the result and measure of the degradation which\nthe earths crust has elsewhere suffered And what an amount of degradation\nis implied by the sedimentary deposits of many countries Professor Ramsay\nhas given me the maximum thickness in most cases from actual measurement\nin a few cases from estimate of each formation in different parts of Great\nBritain and this is the result:\n\n                                                     Feet\n  Palozoic strata not including igneous beds      57154\n  Secondary strata                                   13190\n  Tertiary strata                                     2240\n\nmaking altogether 72584 feet that is very nearly thirteen and\nthreequarters British miles Some of the formations which are represented\nin England by thin beds are thousands of feet in thickness on the\nContinent Moreover between each successive formation we have in the\nopinion of most geologists enormously long blank periods So that the\nlofty pile of sedimentary rocks in Britain gives but an inadequate idea of\nthe time which has elapsed during their accumulation yet what time this\nmust have consumed Good observers have estimated that sediment is\ndeposited by the great Mississippi river at the rate of only 600 feet in a\nhundred thousand years This estimate has no pretension to strict\nexactness yet considering over what wide spaces very fine sediment is\ntransported by the currents of the sea the process of accumulation in any\none area must be extremely slow\n\nBut the amount of denudation which the strata have in many places suffered\nindependently of the rate of accumulation of the degraded matter probably\noffers the best evidence of the lapse of time I remember 285 having been\nmuch struck with the evidence of denudation when viewing volcanic islands\nwhich have been worn by the waves and pared all round into perpendicular\ncliffs of one or two thousand feet in height for the gentle slope of the\nlavastreams due to their formerly liquid state showed at a glance how\nfar the hard rocky beds had once extended into the open ocean The same\nstory is still more plainly told by faultsthose great cracks along which\nthe strata have been upheaved on one side or thrown down on the other to\nthe height or depth of thousands of feet for since the crust cracked the\nsurface of the land has been so completely planed down by the action of the\nsea that no trace of these vast dislocations is externally visible\n\nThe Craven fault for instance extends for upwards of 30 miles and along\nthis line the vertical displacement of the strata has varied from 600 to\n3000 feet Prof Ramsay has published an account of a downthrow in Anglesea\nof 2300 feet and he informs me that he fully believes there is one in\nMerionethshire of 12000 feet yet in these cases there is nothing on the\nsurface to show such prodigious movements the pile of rocks on the one or\nother side having been smoothly swept away The consideration of these\nfacts impresses my mind almost in the same manner as does the vain\nendeavour to grapple with the idea of eternity\n\nI am tempted to give one other case the wellknown one of the denudation\nof the Weald Though it must be admitted that the denudation of the Weald\nhas been a mere trifle in comparison with that which has removed masses of\nour palozoic strata in parts ten thousand feet in thickness as shown in\nProf Ramsays masterly memoir on this subject: yet it is an admirable\nlesson to stand on the intermediate hilly country and look on the one hand\nat the North Downs and 286 on the other hand at the South Downs for\nremembering that at no great distance to the west the northern and southern\nescarpments meet and close one can safely picture to oneself the great\ndome of rocks which must have covered up the Weald within so limited a\nperiod as since the latter part of the Chalk formation The distance from\nthe northern to the southern Downs is about 22 miles and the thickness of\nthe several formations is on an average about 1100 feet as I am informed\nby Prof Ramsay But if as some geologists suppose a range of older rocks\nunderlies the Weald on the flanks of which the overlying sedimentary\ndeposits might have accumulated in thinner masses than elsewhere the above\nestimate would be erroneous but this source of doubt probably would not\ngreatly affect the estimate as applied to the western extremity of the\ndistrict If then we knew the rate at which the sea commonly wears away a\nline of cliff of any given height we could measure the time requisite to\nhave denuded the Weald This of course cannot be done but we may in\norder to form some crude notion on the subject assume that the sea would\neat into cliffs 500 feet in height at the rate of one inch in a century\nThis will at first appear much too small an allowance but it is the same\nas if we were to assume a cliff one yard in height to be eaten back along a\nwhole line of coast at the rate of one yard in nearly every twentytwo\nyears I doubt whether any rock even as soft as chalk would yield at this\nrate excepting on the most exposed coasts though no doubt the degradation\nof a lofty cliff would be more rapid from the breakage of the fallen\nfragments On the other hand I do not believe that any line of coast ten\nor twenty miles in length ever suffers degradation at the same time along\nits whole indented length and we 287 must remember that almost all\nstrata contain harder layers or nodules which from long resisting\nattrition form a breakwater at the base We may at least confidently\nbelieve that no rocky coast 500 feet in height commonly yields at the rate\nof a foot per century for this would be the same in amount as a cliff one\nyard in height retreating twelve yards in twentytwo years and no one I\nthink who has carefully observed the shape of old fallen fragments at the\nbase of cliffs will admit any near approach to such rapid wearing away\nHence under ordinary circumstances I should infer that for a cliff 500\nfeet in height a denudation of one inch per century for the whole length\nwould be a sufficient allowance At this rate on the above data the\ndenudation of the Weald must have required 306662400 years or say three\nhundred million years But perhaps it would be safer to allow two or three\ninches per century and this would reduce the number of years to one\nhundred and fifty or one hundred million years\n\nThe action of fresh water on the gently inclined Wealden district when\nupraised could hardly have been great but it would somewhat reduce the\nabove estimate On the other hand during oscillations of level which we\nknow this area has undergone the surface may have existed for millions of\nyears as land and thus have escaped the action of the sea: when deeply\nsubmerged for perhaps equally long periods it would likewise have\nescaped the action of the coastwaves So that it is not improbable that a\nlonger period than 300 million years has elapsed since the latter part of\nthe Secondary period\n\nI have made these few remarks because it is highly important for us to gain\nsome notion however imperfect of the lapse of years During each of these\nyears 288 over the whole world the land and the water has been peopled\nby hosts of living forms What an infinite number of generations which the\nmind cannot grasp must have succeeded each other in the long roll of\nyears Now turn to our richest geological museums and what a paltry\ndisplay we behold\n\n\n\nOn the poorness of our Palontological collectionsThat our\npalontological collections are very imperfect is admitted by every one\nThe remark of that admirable palontologist the late Edward Forbes should\nnot be forgotten namely that numbers of our fossil species are known and\nnamed from single and often broken specimens or from a few specimens\ncollected on some one spot Only a small portion of the surface of the\nearth has been geologically explored and no part with sufficient care as\nthe important discoveries made every year in Europe prove No organism\nwholly soft can be preserved Shells and bones will decay and disappear\nwhen left on the bottom of the sea where sediment is not accumulating I\nbelieve we are continually taking a most erroneous view when we tacitly\nadmit to ourselves that sediment is being deposited over nearly the whole\nbed of the sea at a rate sufficiently quick to embed and preserve fossil\nremains Throughout an enormously large proportion of the ocean the bright\nblue tint of the water bespeaks its purity The many cases on record of a\nformation conformably covered after an enormous interval of time by\nanother and later formation without the underlying bed having suffered in\nthe interval any wear and tear seem explicable only on the view of the\nbottom of the sea not rarely lying for ages in an unaltered condition The\nremains which do become embedded if in sand or gravel will when the beds\nare upraised generally be dissolved 289 by the percolation of rainwater\nI suspect that but few of the very many animals which live on the beach\nbetween high and low watermark are preserved For instance the several\nspecies of the Chthamalin a subfamily of sessile cirripedes coat the\nrocks all over the world in infinite numbers: they are all strictly\nlittoral with the exception of a single Mediterranean species which\ninhabits deep water and has been found fossil in Sicily whereas not one\nother species has hitherto been found in any tertiary formation: yet it is\nnow known that the genus Chthamalus existed during the chalk period The\nmolluscan genus Chiton offers a partially analogous case\n\nWith respect to the terrestrial productions which lived during the\nSecondary and Palozoic periods it is superfluous to state that our\nevidence from fossil remains is fragmentary in an extreme degree For\ninstance not a land shell is known belonging to either of these vast\nperiods with the exception of one species discovered by Sir C Lyell and\nDr Dawson in the carboniferous strata of North America of which shell\nseveral specimens have now been collected In regard to mammiferous\nremains a single glance at the historical table published in the\nSupplement to Lyells Manual will bring home the truth how accidental and\nrare is their preservation far better than pages of detail Nor is their\nrarity surprising when we remember how large a proportion of the bones of\ntertiary mammals have been discovered either in caves or in lacustrine\ndeposits and that not a cave or true lacustrine bed is known belonging to\nthe age of our secondary or palozoic formations\n\nBut the imperfection in the geological record mainly results from another\nand more important cause than any of the foregoing namely from the\nseveral formations 290 being separated from each other by wide intervals\nof time When we see the formations tabulated in written works or when we\nfollow them in nature it is difficult to avoid believing that they are\nclosely consecutive But we know for instance from Sir R Murchisons\ngreat work on Russia what wide gaps there are in that country between the\nsuperimposed formations so it is in North America and in many other parts\nof the world The most skilful geologist if his attention had been\nexclusively confined to these large territories would never have suspected\nthat during the periods which were blank and barren in his own country\ngreat piles of sediment charged with new and peculiar forms of life had\nelsewhere been accumulated And if in each separate territory hardly any\nidea can be formed of the length of time which has elapsed between the\nconsecutive formations we may infer that this could nowhere be\nascertained The frequent and great changes in the mineralogical\ncomposition of consecutive formations generally implying great changes in\nthe geography of the surrounding lands whence the sediment has been\nderived accords with the belief of vast intervals of time having elapsed\nbetween each formation\n\nBut we can I think see why the geological formations of each region are\nalmost invariably intermittent that is have not followed each other in\nclose sequence Scarcely any fact struck me more when examining many\nhundred miles of the South American coasts which have been upraised\nseveral hundred feet within the recent period than the absence of any\nrecent deposits sufficiently extensive to last for even a short geological\nperiod Along the whole west coast which is inhabited by a peculiar marine\nfauna tertiary beds are so poorly developed that no record of several\n291 successive and peculiar marine faunas will probably be preserved to a\ndistant age A little reflection will explain why along the rising coast of\nthe western side of South America no extensive formations with recent or\ntertiary remains can anywhere be found though the supply of sediment must\nfor ages have been great from the enormous degradation of the coastrocks\nand from muddy streams entering the sea The explanation no doubt is\nthat the littoral and sublittoral deposits are continually worn away as\nsoon as they are brought up by the slow and gradual rising of the land\nwithin the grinding action of the coastwaves\n\nWe may I think safely conclude that sediment must be accumulated in\nextremely thick solid or extensive masses in order to withstand the\nincessant action of the waves when first upraised and during subsequent\noscillations of level Such thick and extensive accumulations of sediment\nmay be formed in two ways either in profound depths of the sea in which\ncase judging from the researches of E Forbes we may conclude that the\nbottom will be inhabited by extremely few animals and the mass when\nupraised will give a most imperfect record of the forms of life which then\nexisted or sediment may be accumulated to any thickness and extent over a\nshallow bottom if it continue slowly to subside In this latter case as\nlong as the rate of subsidence and supply of sediment nearly balance each\nother the sea will remain shallow and favourable for life and thus a\nfossiliferous formation thick enough when upraised to resist any amount\nof degradation may be formed\n\nI am convinced that all our ancient formations which are rich in fossils\nhave thus been formed during subsidence Since publishing my views on this\nsubject in 1845 I have watched the progress of 292 Geology and have\nbeen surprised to note how author after author in treating of this or that\ngreat formation has come to the conclusion that it was accumulated during\nsubsidence I may add that the only ancient tertiary formation on the west\ncoast of South America which has been bulky enough to resist such\ndegradation as it has as yet suffered but which will hardly last to a\ndistant geological age was certainly deposited during a downward\noscillation of level and thus gained considerable thickness\n\nAll geological facts tell us plainly that each area has undergone numerous\nslow oscillations of level and apparently these oscillations have affected\nwide spaces Consequently formations rich in fossils and sufficiently thick\nand extensive to resist subsequent degradation may have been formed over\nwide spaces during periods of subsidence but only where the supply of\nsediment was sufficient to keep the sea shallow and to embed and preserve\nthe remains before they had time to decay On the other hand as long as\nthe bed of the sea remained stationary thick deposits could not have\nbeen accumulated in the shallow parts which are the most favourable to\nlife Still less could this have happened during the alternate periods of\nelevation or to speak more accurately the beds which were then\naccumulated will have been destroyed by being upraised and brought within\nthe limits of the coastaction\n\nThus the geological record will almost necessarily be rendered\nintermittent I feel much confidence in the truth of these views for they\nare in strict accordance with the general principles inculcated by Sir C\nLyell and E Forbes subsequently but independently arrived at a similar\nconclusion\n\nOne remark is here worth a passing notice During periods of elevation the\narea of the land and of the 293 adjoining shoal parts of the sea will be\nincreased and new stations will often be formedall circumstances most\nfavourable as previously explained for the formation of new varieties and\nspecies but during such periods there will generally be a blank in the\ngeological record On the other hand during subsidence the inhabited area\nand number of inhabitants will decrease excepting the productions on the\nshores of a continent when first broken up into an archipelago and\nconsequently during subsidence though there will be much extinction fewer\nnew varieties or species will be formed and it is during these very\nperiods of subsidence that our great deposits rich in fossils have been\naccumulated Nature may almost be said to have guarded against the frequent\ndiscovery of her transitional or linking forms\n\nFrom the foregoing considerations it cannot be doubted that the geological\nrecord viewed as a whole is extremely imperfect but if we confine our\nattention to any one formation it becomes more difficult to understand\nwhy we do not therein find closely graduated varieties between the allied\nspecies which lived at its commencement and at its close Some cases are on\nrecord of the same species presenting distinct varieties in the upper and\nlower parts of the same formation but as they are rare they may be here\npassed over Although each formation has indisputably required a vast\nnumber of years for its deposition I can see several reasons why each\nshould not include a graduated series of links between the species which\nthen lived but I can by no means pretend to assign due proportional weight\nto the following considerations\n\nAlthough each formation may mark a very long lapse of years each perhaps\nis short compared with the period requisite to change one species into\nanother I am 294 aware that two palontologists whose opinions are\nworthy of much deference namely Bronn and Woodward have concluded that\nthe average duration of each formation is twice or thrice as long as the\naverage duration of specific forms But insuperable difficulties as it\nseems to me prevent us coming to any just conclusion on this head When we\nsee a species first appearing in the middle of any formation it would be\nrash in the extreme to infer that it had not elsewhere previously existed\nSo again when we find a species disappearing before the uppermost layers\nhave been deposited it would be equally rash to suppose that it then\nbecame wholly extinct We forget how small the area of Europe is compared\nwith the rest of the world nor have the several stages of the same\nformation throughout Europe been correlated with perfect accuracy\n\nWith marine animals of all kinds we may safely infer a large amount of\nmigration during climatal and other changes and when we see a species\nfirst appearing in any formation the probability is that it only then\nfirst immigrated into that area It is well known for instance that\nseveral species appeared somewhat earlier in the palozoic beds of North\nAmerica than in those of Europe time having apparently been required for\ntheir migration from the American to the European seas In examining the\nlatest deposits of various quarters of the world it has everywhere been\nnoted that some few still existing species are common in the deposit but\nhave become extinct in the immediately surrounding sea or conversely\nthat some are now abundant in the neighbouring sea but are rare or absent\nin this particular deposit It is an excellent lesson to reflect on the\nascertained amount of migration of the inhabitants of Europe during the\nGlacial period which forms only a part of one whole geological period\n295 and likewise to reflect on the great changes of level on the\ninordinately great change of climate on the prodigious lapse of time all\nincluded within this same glacial period Yet it may be doubted whether in\nany quarter of the world sedimentary deposits including fossil remains\nhave gone on accumulating within the same area during the whole of this\nperiod It is not for instance probable that sediment was deposited\nduring the whole of the glacial period near the mouth of the Mississippi\nwithin that limit of depth at which marine animals can flourish for we\nknow what vast geographical changes occurred in other parts of America\nduring this space of time When such beds as were deposited in shallow\nwater near the mouth of the Mississippi during some part of the glacial\nperiod shall have been upraised organic remains will probably first appear\nand disappear at different levels owing to the migration of species and to\ngeographical changes And in the distant future a geologist examining\nthese beds might be tempted to conclude that the average duration of life\nof the embedded fossils had been less than that of the glacial period\ninstead of having been really far greater that is extending from before\nthe glacial epoch to the present day\n\nIn order to get a perfect gradation between two forms in the upper and\nlower parts of the same formation the deposit must have gone on\naccumulating for a very long period in order to have given sufficient time\nfor the slow process of variation hence the deposit will generally have to\nbe a very thick one and the species undergoing modification will have had\nto live on the same area throughout this whole time But we have seen that\na thick fossiliferous formation can only be accumulated during a period of\nsubsidence and to keep the depth approximately the same which is\nnecessary in 296 order to enable the same species to live on the same\nspace the supply of sediment must nearly have counterbalanced the amount\nof subsidence But this same movement of subsidence will often tend to sink\nthe area whence the sediment is derived and thus diminish the supply\nwhilst the downward movement continues In fact this nearly exact\nbalancing between the supply of sediment and the amount of subsidence is\nprobably a rare contingency for it has been observed by more than one\npalontologist that very thick deposits are usually barren of organic\nremains except near their upper or lower limits\n\nIt would seem that each separate formation like the whole pile of\nformations in any country has generally been intermittent in its\naccumulation When we see as is so often the case a formation composed of\nbeds of different mineralogical composition we may reasonably suspect that\nthe process of deposition has been much interrupted as a change in the\ncurrents of the sea and a supply of sediment of a different nature will\ngenerally have been due to geographical changes requiring much time Nor\nwill the closest inspection of a formation give any idea of the time which\nits deposition has consumed Many instances could be given of beds only a\nfew feet in thickness representing formations elsewhere thousands of feet\nin thickness and which must have required an enormous period for their\naccumulation yet no one ignorant of this fact would have suspected the\nvast lapse of time represented by the thinner formation Many cases could\nbe given of the lower beds of a formation having been upraised denuded\nsubmerged and then recovered by the upper beds of the same\nformationfacts showing what wide yet easily overlooked intervals have\noccurred in its accumulation In other cases we have the plainest evidence\n297 in great fossilised trees still standing upright as they grew of\nmany long intervals of time and changes of level during the process of\ndeposition which would never even have been suspected had not the trees\nchanced to have been preserved: thus Messrs Lyell and Dawson found\ncarboniferous beds 1400 feet thick in Nova Scotia with ancient\nrootbearing strata one above the other at no less than sixtyeight\ndifferent levels Hence when the same species occur at the bottom middle\nand top of a formation the probability is that they have not lived on the\nsame spot during the whole period of deposition but have disappeared and\nreappeared perhaps many times during the same geological period So that\nif such species were to undergo a considerable amount of modification\nduring any one geological period a section would not probably include all\nthe fine intermediate gradations which must on my theory have existed\nbetween them but abrupt though perhaps very slight changes of form\n\nIt is allimportant to remember that naturalists have no golden rule by\nwhich to distinguish species and varieties they grant some little\nvariability to each species but when they meet with a somewhat greater\namount of difference between any two forms they rank both as species\nunless they are enabled to connect them together by close intermediate\ngradations And this from the reasons just assigned we can seldom hope to\neffect in any one geological section Supposing B and C to be two species\nand a third A to be found in an underlying bed even if A were strictly\nintermediate between B and C it would simply be ranked as a third and\ndistinct species unless at the same time it could be most closely\nconnected with either one or both forms by intermediate varieties Nor\nshould it be forgotten as before explained that A might be the actual\nprogenitor 298 of B and C and yet might not at all necessarily be\nstrictly intermediate between them in all points of structure So that we\nmight obtain the parentspecies and its several modified descendants from\nthe lower and upper beds of a formation and unless we obtained numerous\ntransitional gradations we should not recognise their relationship and\nshould consequently be compelled to rank them all as distinct species\n\nIt is notorious on what excessively slight differences many palontologists\nhave founded their species and they do this the more readily if the\nspecimens come from different substages of the same formation Some\nexperienced conchologists are now sinking many of the very fine species of\nDOrbigny and others into the rank of varieties and on this view we do\nfind the kind of evidence of change which on my theory we ought to find\nMoreover if we look to rather wider intervals namely to distinct but\nconsecutive stages of the same great formation we find that the embedded\nfossils though almost universally ranked as specifically different yet\nare far more closely allied to each other than are the species found in\nmore widely separated formations but to this subject I shall have to\nreturn in the following chapter\n\nOne other consideration is worth notice: with animals and plants that can\npropagate rapidly and are not highly locomotive there is reason to\nsuspect as we have formerly seen that their varieties are generally at\nfirst local and that such local varieties do not spread widely and\nsupplant their parentforms until they have been modified and perfected in\nsome considerable degree According to this view the chance of discovering\nin a formation in any one country all the early stages of transition\nbetween any two forms is small for the successive changes are supposed to\nhave been local or 299 confined to some one spot Most marine animals\nhave a wide range and we have seen that with plants it is those which have\nthe widest range that oftenest present varieties so that with shells and\nother marine animals it is probably those which have had the widest range\nfar exceeding the limits of the known geological formations of Europe\nwhich have oftenest given rise first to local varieties and ultimately to\nnew species and this again would greatly lessen the chance of our being\nable to trace the stages of transition in any one geological formation\n\nIt should not be forgotten that at the present day with perfect specimens\nfor examination two forms can seldom be connected by intermediate\nvarieties and thus proved to be the same species until many specimens have\nbeen collected from many places and in the case of fossil species this\ncould rarely be effected by palontologists We shall perhaps best\nperceive the improbability of our being enabled to connect species by\nnumerous fine intermediate fossil links by asking ourselves whether\nfor instance geologists at some future period will be able to prove that\nour different breeds of cattle sheep horses and dogs have descended from\na single stock or from several aboriginal stocks or again whether\ncertain seashells inhabiting the shores of North America which are ranked\nby some conchologists as distinct species from their European\nrepresentatives and by other conchologists as only varieties are really\nvarieties or are as it is called specifically distinct This could be\neffected only by the future geologist discovering in a fossil state\nnumerous intermediate gradations and such success seems to me improbable\nin the highest degree\n\nGeological research though it has added numerous species to existing and\nextinct genera and has made the 300 intervals between some few groups\nless wide than they otherwise would have been yet has done scarcely\nanything in breaking down the distinction between species by connecting\nthem together by numerous fine intermediate varieties and this not\nhaving been effected is probably the gravest and most obvious of all the\nmany objections which may be urged against my views Hence it will be worth\nwhile to sum up the foregoing remarks under an imaginary illustration The\nMalay Archipelago is of about the size of Europe from the North Cape to the\nMediterranean and from Britain to Russia and therefore equals all the\ngeological formations which have been examined with any accuracy excepting\nthose of the United States of America I fully agree with Mr\nGodwinAusten that the present condition of the Malay Archipelago with\nits numerous large islands separated by wide and shallow seas probably\nrepresents the former state of Europe whilst most of our formations were\naccumulating The Malay Archipelago is one of the richest regions of the\nwhole world in organic beings yet if all the species were to be collected\nwhich have ever lived there how imperfectly would they represent the\nnatural history of the world\n\nBut we have every reason to believe that the terrestrial productions of the\narchipelago would be preserved in an excessively imperfect manner in the\nformations which we suppose to be there accumulating I suspect that not\nmany of the strictly littoral animals or of those which lived on naked\nsubmarine rocks would be embedded and those embedded in gravel or sand\nwould not endure to a distant epoch Wherever sediment did not accumulate\non the bed of the sea or where it did not accumulate at a sufficient rate\nto protect organic bodies from decay no remains could be preserved\n\nI believe that fossiliferous formations could be formed 301 in the\narchipelago of thickness sufficient to last to an age as distant in\nfuturity as the secondary formations lie in the past only during periods\nof subsidence These periods of subsidence would be separated from each\nother by enormous intervals during which the area would be either\nstationary or rising whilst rising each fossiliferous formation would be\ndestroyed almost as soon as accumulated by the incessant coastaction as\nwe now see on the shores of South America During the periods of subsidence\nthere would probably be much extinction of life during the periods of\nelevation there would be much variation but the geological record would\nthen be least perfect\n\nIt may be doubted whether the duration of any one great period of\nsubsidence over the whole or part of the archipelago together with a\ncontemporaneous accumulation of sediment would exceed the average\nduration of the same specific forms and these contingencies are\nindispensable for the preservation of all the transitional gradations\nbetween any two or more species If such gradations were not fully\npreserved transitional varieties would merely appear as so many distinct\nspecies It is also probable that each great period of subsidence would\nbe interrupted by oscillations of level and that slight climatal changes\nwould intervene during such lengthy periods and in these cases the\ninhabitants of the archipelago would have to migrate and no closely\nconsecutive record of their modifications could be preserved in any one\nformation\n\nVery many of the marine inhabitants of the archipelago now range thousands\nof miles beyond its confines and analogy leads me to believe that it would\nbe chiefly these farranging species which would oftenest produce new\nvarieties and the varieties would at first generally be local or confined\nto one place but if possessed 302 of any decided advantage or when\nfurther modified and improved they would slowly spread and supplant their\nparentforms When such varieties returned to their ancient homes as they\nwould differ from their former state in a nearly uniform though perhaps\nextremely slight degree they would according to the principles followed\nby many palontologists be ranked as new and distinct species\n\nIf then there be some degree of truth in these remarks we have no right\nto expect to find in our geological formations an infinite number of those\nfine transitional forms which on my theory assuredly have connected all\nthe past and present species of the same group into one long and branching\nchain of life We ought only to look for a few links some more closely\nsome more distantly related to each other and these links let them be\never so close if found in different stages of the same formation would\nby most palontologists be ranked as distinct species But I do not\npretend that I should ever have suspected how poor a record of the\nmutations of life the best preserved geological section presented had not\nthe difficulty of our not discovering innumerable transitional links\nbetween the species which appeared at the commencement and close of each\nformation pressed so hardly on my theory\n\n\n\nOn the sudden appearance of whole groups of Allied SpeciesThe abrupt\nmanner in which whole groups of species suddenly appear in certain\nformations has been urged by several palontologistsfor instance by\nAgassiz Pictet and by none more forcibly than by Professor Sedgwickas a\nfatal objection to the belief in the transmutation of species If numerous\nspecies belonging to the same genera or families have really 303\nstarted into life all at once the fact would be fatal to the theory of\ndescent with slow modification through natural selection For the\ndevelopment of a group of forms all of which have descended from some one\nprogenitor must have been an extremely slow process and the progenitors\nmust have lived long ages before their modified descendants But we\ncontinually overrate the perfection of the geological record and falsely\ninfer because certain genera or families have not been found beneath a\ncertain stage that they did not exist before that stage We continually\nforget how large the world is compared with the area over which our\ngeological formations have been carefully examined we forget that groups\nof species may elsewhere have long existed and have slowly multiplied\nbefore they invaded the ancient archipelagoes of Europe and of the United\nStates We do not make due allowance for the enormous intervals of time\nwhich have probably elapsed between our consecutive formationslonger\nperhaps in most cases than the time required for the accumulation of each\nformation These intervals will have given time for the multiplication of\nspecies from some one or some few parentforms and in the succeeding\nformation such species will appear as if suddenly created\n\nI may here recall a remark formerly made namely that it might require a\nlong succession of ages to adapt an organism to some new and peculiar line\nof life for instance to fly through the air but that when this had been\neffected and a few species had thus acquired a great advantage over other\norganisms a comparatively short time would be necessary to produce many\ndivergent forms which would be able to spread rapidly and widely\nthroughout the world\n\nI will now give a few examples to illustrate these 304 remarks and to\nshow how liable we are to error in supposing that whole groups of species\nhave suddenly been produced I may recall the wellknown fact that in\ngeological treatises published not many years ago the great class of\nmammals was always spoken of as having abruptly come in at the commencement\nof the tertiary series And now one of the richest known accumulations of\nfossil mammals for its thickness belongs to the middle of the secondary\nseries and one true mammal has been discovered in the new red sandstone at\nnearly the commencement of this great series Cuvier used to urge that no\nmonkey occurred in any tertiary stratum but now extinct species have been\ndiscovered in India South America and in Europe even as far back as the\neocene stage Had it not been for the rare accident of the preservation of\nfootsteps in the new red sandstone of the United States who would have\nventured to suppose that besides reptiles no less than at least thirty\nkinds of birds some of gigantic size existed during that period Not a\nfragment of bone has been discovered in these beds Notwithstanding that\nthe number of joints shown in the fossil impressions correspond with the\nnumber in the several toes of living birds feet some authors doubt\nwhether the animals which left the impressions were really birds Until\nquite recently these authors might have maintained and some have\nmaintained that the whole class of birds came suddenly into existence\nduring an early tertiary period but now we know on the authority of\nProfessor Owen as may be seen in Lyells Manual that a bird certainly\nlived during the deposition of the upper greensand\n\nI may give another instance which from having passed under my own eyes has\nmuch struck me In a memoir on Fossil Sessile Cirripedes I have stated\nthat from the 305 number of existing and extinct tertiary species from\nthe extraordinary abundance of the individuals of many species all over the\nworld from the Arctic regions to the equator inhabiting various zones of\ndepths from the upper tidal limits to 50 fathoms from the perfect manner\nin which specimens are preserved in the oldest tertiary beds from the ease\nwith which even a fragment of a valve can be recognised from all these\ncircumstances I inferred that had sessile cirripedes existed during the\nsecondary periods they would certainly have been preserved and discovered\nand as not one species had then been discovered in beds of this age I\nconcluded that this great group had been suddenly developed at the\ncommencement of the tertiary series This was a sore trouble to me adding\nas I thought one more instance of the abrupt appearance of a great group of\nspecies But my work had hardly been published when a skilful\npalontologist M Bosquet sent me a drawing of a perfect specimen of an\nunmistakeable sessile cirripede which he had himself extracted from the\nchalk of Belgium And as if to make the case as striking as possible this\nsessile cirripede was a Chthamalus a very common large and ubiquitous\ngenus of which not one specimen has as yet been found even in any tertiary\nstratum Hence we now positively know that sessile cirripedes existed\nduring the secondary period and these cirripedes might have been the\nprogenitors of our many tertiary and existing species\n\nThe case most frequently insisted on by palontologists of the apparently\nsudden appearance of a whole group of species is that of the teleostean\nfishes low down in the Chalk period This group includes the large\nmajority of existing species Lately Professor Pictet has carried their\nexistence one substage further back and some palontologists believe that\ncertain 306 much older fishes of which the affinities are as yet\nimperfectly known are really teleostean Assuming however that the whole\nof them did appear as Agassiz believes at the commencement of the chalk\nformation the fact would certainly be highly remarkable but I cannot see\nthat it would be an insuperable difficulty on my theory unless it could\nlikewise be shown that the species of this group appeared suddenly and\nsimultaneously throughout the world at this same period It is almost\nsuperfluous to remark that hardly any fossilfish are known from south of\nthe equator and by running through Pictets Palontology it will be seen\nthat very few species are known from several formations in Europe Some few\nfamilies of fish now have a confined range the teleostean fish might\nformerly have had a similarly confined range and after having been largely\ndeveloped in some one sea might have spread widely Nor have we any right\nto suppose that the seas of the world have always been so freely open from\nsouth to north as they are at present Even at this day if the Malay\nArchipelago were converted into land the tropical parts of the Indian\nOcean would form a large and perfectly enclosed basin in which any great\ngroup of marine animals might be multiplied and here they would remain\nconfined until some of the species became adapted to a cooler climate and\nwere enabled to double the southern capes of Africa or Australia and thus\nreach other and distant seas\n\nFrom these and similar considerations but chiefly from our ignorance of\nthe geology of other countries beyond the confines of Europe and the United\nStates and from the revolution in our palontological ideas on many\npoints which the discoveries of even the last dozen years have effected\nit seems to me to be about as rash in us to dogmatize on the succession of\norganic 307 beings throughout the world as it would be for a naturalist\nto land for five minutes on some one barren point in Australia and then to\ndiscuss the number and range of its productions\n\n\n\nOn the sudden appearance of groups of Allied Species in the lowest known\nfossiliferous strataThere is another and allied difficulty which is\nmuch graver I allude to the manner in which numbers of species of the same\ngroup suddenly appear in the lowest known fossiliferous rocks Most of the\narguments which have convinced me that all the existing species of the same\ngroup have descended from one progenitor apply with nearly equal force to\nthe earliest known species For instance I cannot doubt that all the\nSilurian trilobites have descended from some one crustacean which must\nhave lived long before the Silurian age and which probably differed\ngreatly from any known animal Some of the most ancient Silurian animals\nas the Nautilus Lingula c do not differ much from living species and\nit cannot on my theory be supposed that these old species were the\nprogenitors of all the species of the orders to which they belong for they\ndo not present characters in any degree intermediate between them If\nmoreover they had been the progenitors of these orders they would almost\ncertainly have been long ago supplanted and exterminated by their numerous\nand improved descendants\n\nConsequently if my theory be true it is indisputable that before the\nlowest Silurian stratum was deposited long periods elapsed as long as or\nprobably far longer than the whole interval from the Silurian age to the\npresent day and that during these vast yet quite unknown periods of\ntime the world swarmed with living creatures 308\n\nTo the question why we do not find records of these vast primordial\nperiods I can give no satisfactory answer Several of the most eminent\ngeologists with Sir E Murchison at their head are convinced that we see\nin the organic remains of the lowest Silurian stratum the dawn of life on\nthis planet Other highly competent judges as Lyell and the late E\nForbes dispute this conclusion We should not forget that only a small\nportion of the world is known with accuracy M Barrande has lately added\nanother and lower stage to the Silurian system abounding with new and\npeculiar species Traces of life have been detected in the Longmynd beds\nbeneath Barrandes socalled primordial zone The presence of phosphatic\nnodules and bituminous matter in some of the lowest azoic rocks probably\nindicates the former existence of life at these periods But the difficulty\nof understanding the absence of vast piles of fossiliferous strata which\non my theory no doubt were somewhere accumulated before the Silurian epoch\nis very great If these most ancient beds had been wholly worn away by\ndenudation or obliterated by metamorphic action we ought to find only\nsmall remnants of the formations next succeeding them in age and these\nought to be very generally in a metamorphosed condition But the\ndescriptions which we now possess of the Silurian deposits over immense\nterritories in Russia and in North America do not support the view that\nthe older a formation is the more it has always suffered the extremity of\ndenudation and metamorphism\n\nThe case at present must remain inexplicable and may be truly urged as a\nvalid argument against the views here entertained To show that it may\nhereafter receive some explanation I will give the following hypothesis\nFrom the nature of the organic remains which 309 do not appear to have\ninhabited profound depths in the several formations of Europe and of the\nUnited States and from the amount of sediment miles in thickness of\nwhich the formations are composed we may infer that from first to last\nlarge islands or tracts of land whence the sediment was derived occurred\nin the neighbourhood of the existing continents of Europe and North\nAmerica But we do not know what was the state of things in the intervals\nbetween the successive formations whether Europe and the United States\nduring these intervals existed as dry land or as a submarine surface near\nland on which sediment was not deposited or as the bed of an open and\nunfathomable sea\n\nLooking to the existing oceans which are thrice as extensive as the land\nwe see them studded with many islands but not one oceanic island is as yet\nknown to afford even a remnant of any palozoic or secondary formation\nHence we may perhaps infer that during the palozoic and secondary\nperiods neither continents nor continental islands existed where our\noceans now extend for had they existed there palozoic and secondary\nformations would in all probability have been accumulated from sediment\nderived from their wear and tear and would have been at least partially\nupheaved by the oscillations of level which we may fairly conclude must\nhave intervened during these enormously long periods If then we may infer\nanything from these facts we may infer that where our oceans now extend\noceans have extended from the remotest period of which we have any record\nand on the other hand that where continents now exist large tracts of\nland have existed subjected no doubt to great oscillations of level since\nthe earliest silurian period The coloured map appended to my volume on\nCoral Reefs led me to conclude that the great oceans are still mainly\nareas of 310 subsidence the great archipelagoes still areas of\noscillations of level and the continents areas of elevation But have we\nany right to assume that things have thus remained from the beginning of\nthis world Our continents seem to have been formed by a preponderance\nduring many oscillations of level of the force of elevation but may not\nthe areas of preponderant movement have changed in the lapse of ages At a\nperiod immeasurably antecedent to the silurian epoch continents may have\nexisted where oceans are now spread out and clear and open oceans may have\nexisted where our continents now stand Nor should we be justified in\nassuming that if for instance the bed of the Pacific Ocean were now\nconverted into a continent we should there find formations older than the\nsilurian strata supposing such to have been formerly deposited for it\nmight well happen that strata which had subsided some miles nearer to the\ncentre of the earth and which had been pressed on by an enormous weight of\nsuperincumbent water might have undergone far more metamorphic action than\nstrata which have always remained nearer to the surface The immense areas\nin some parts of the world for instance in South America of bare\nmetamorphic rocks which must have been heated under great pressure have\nalways seemed to me to require some special explanation and we may perhaps\nbelieve that we see in these large areas the many formations long anterior\nto the silurian epoch in a completely metamorphosed condition\n\n\n\nThe several difficulties here discussed namely our not finding in the\nsuccessive formations infinitely numerous transitional links between the\nmany species which now exist or have existed the sudden manner 311 in\nwhich whole groups of species appear in our European formations the almost\nentire absence as at present known of fossiliferous formations beneath\nthe Silurian strata are all undoubtedly of the gravest nature We see this\nin the plainest manner by the fact that all the most eminent\npalontologists namely Cuvier Agassiz Barrande Falconer E Forbes\nc and all our greatest geologists as Lyell Murchison Sedgwick c\nhave unanimously often vehemently maintained the immutability of species\nBut I have reason to believe that one great authority Sir Charles Lyell\nfrom further reflexion entertains grave doubts on this subject I feel how\nrash it is to differ from these authorities to whom with others we owe\nall our knowledge Those who think the natural geological record in any\ndegree perfect and who do not attach much weight to the facts and\narguments of other kinds given in this volume will undoubtedly at once\nreject my theory For my part following out Lyells metaphor I look at\nthe natural geological record as a history of the world imperfectly kept\nand written in a changing dialect of this history we possess the last\nvolume alone relating only to two or three countries Of this volume only\nhere and there a short chapter has been preserved and of each page only\nhere and there a few lines Each word of the slowlychanging language in\nwhich the history is supposed to be written being more or less different\nin the interrupted succession of chapters may represent the apparently\nabruptly changed forms of life entombed in our consecutive but widely\nseparated formations On this view the difficulties above discussed are\ngreatly diminished or even disappear\n\n                                   \n\n\n312\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nON THE GEOLOGICAL

species to each other and to living speciesOn the state of\n    development of ancient formsOn the succession of the same types\n    within the same areasSummary of preceding and present chapters\n\nLet us now see whether the several facts and rules relating to the\ngeological succession of organic beings better accord with the common view\nof the immutability of species or with that of their slow and gradual\nmodification through descent and natural selection\n\nNew species have appeared very slowly one after another both on the land\nand in the waters Lyell has shown that it is hardly possible to resist the\nevidence on this head in the case of the several tertiary stages and every\nyear tends to fill up the blanks between them and to make the percentage\nsystem of lost and new forms more gradual In some of the most recent beds\nthough undoubtedly of high antiquity if measured by years only one or two\nspecies are lost forms and only one or two are new forms having here\nappeared for the first time either locally or as far as we know on the\nface of the earth If we may trust the observations of Philippi in Sicily\nthe successive changes in the marine inhabitants of that island have been\nmany and most gradual The secondary formations are more broken but as\nBronn has remarked neither the appearance 313 nor disappearance of their\nmany now extinct species has been simultaneous in each separate formation\n\nSpecies of different genera and classes have not changed at the same rate\nor in the same degree In the oldest tertiary beds a few living shells may\nstill be found in the midst of a multitude of extinct forms Falconer has\ngiven a striking instance of a similar fact in an existing crocodile\nassociated with many strange and lost mammals and reptiles in the\nsubHimalayan deposits The Silurian Lingula differs but little from the\nliving species of this genus whereas most of the other Silurian Molluscs\nand all the Crustaceans have changed greatly The productions of the land\nseem to change at a quicker rate than those of the sea of which a striking\ninstance has lately been observed in Switzerland There is some reason to\nbelieve that organisms considered high in the scale of nature change more\nquickly than those that are low: though there are exceptions to this rule\nThe amount of organic change as Pictet has remarked does not strictly\ncorrespond with the succession of our geological formations so that\nbetween each two consecutive formations the forms of life have seldom\nchanged in exactly the same degree Yet if we compare any but the most\nclosely related formations all the species will be found to have undergone\nsome change When a species has once disappeared from the face of the\nearth we have reason to believe that the same identical form never\nreappears The strongest apparent exception to this latter rule is that of\nthe socalled colonies of M Barrande which intrude for a period in the\nmidst of an older formation and then allow the preexisting fauna to\nreappear but Lyells explanation namely that it is a case of temporary\nmigration from a distinct geographical province seems to me satisfactory\n314\n\nThese several facts accord well with my theory I believe in no fixed law\nof development causing all the inhabitants of a country to change\nabruptly or simultaneously or to an equal degree The process of\nmodification must be extremely slow The variability of each species is\nquite independent of that of all others Whether such variability be taken\nadvantage of by natural selection and whether the variations be\naccumulated to a greater or lesser amount thus causing a greater or lesser\namount of modification in the varying species depends on many complex\ncontingencieson the variability being of a beneficial nature on the\npower of intercrossing on the rate of breeding on the slowly changing\nphysical conditions of the country and more especially on the nature of\nthe other inhabitants with which the varying species comes into\ncompetition Hence it is by no means surprising that one species should\nretain the same identical form much longer than others or if changing\nthat it should change less We see the same fact in geographical\ndistribution for instance in the landshells and coleopterous insects of\nMadeira having come to differ considerably from their nearest allies on the\ncontinent of Europe whereas the marine shells and birds have remained\nunaltered We can perhaps understand the apparently quicker rate of change\nin terrestrial and in more highly organised productions compared with\nmarine and lower productions by the more complex relations of the higher\nbeings to their organic and inorganic conditions of life as explained in a\nformer chapter When many of the inhabitants of a country have become\nmodified and improved we can understand on the principle of competition\nand on that of the many allimportant relations of organism to organism\nthat any form which does not become in some degree modified and improved\n315 will be liable to be exterminated Hence we can see why all the\nspecies in the same region do at last if we look to wide enough intervals\nof time become modified for those which do not change will become\nextinct\n\nIn members of the same class the average amount of change during long and\nequal periods of time may perhaps be nearly the same but as the\naccumulation of longenduring fossiliferous formations depends on great\nmasses of sediment having been deposited on areas whilst subsiding our\nformations have been almost necessarily accumulated at wide and irregularly\nintermittent intervals consequently the amount of organic change exhibited\nby the fossils embedded in consecutive formations is not equal Each\nformation on this view does not mark a new and complete act of creation\nbut only an occasional scene taken almost at hazard in a slowly changing\ndrama\n\nWe can clearly understand why a species when once lost should never\nreappear even if the very same conditions of life organic and inorganic\nshould recur For though the offspring of one species might be adapted and\nno doubt this has occurred in innumerable instances to fill the exact\nplace of another species in the economy of nature and thus supplant it\nyet the two formsthe old and the newwould not be identically the same\nfor both would almost certainly inherit different characters from their\ndistinct progenitors For instance it is just possible if our\nfantailpigeons were all destroyed that fanciers by striving during long\nages for the same object might make a new breed hardly distinguishable\nfrom our present fantail but if the parent rockpigeon were also\ndestroyed and in nature we have every reason to believe that the\nparentform will generally be supplanted and exterminated by its improved\noffspring it is quite 316 incredible that a fantail identical with the\nexisting breed could be raised from any other species of pigeon or even\nfrom the other wellestablished races of the domestic pigeon for the\nnewlyformed fantail would be almost sure to inherit from its new\nprogenitor some slight characteristic differences\n\nGroups of species that is genera and families follow the same general\nrules in their appearance and disappearance as do single species changing\nmore or less quickly and in a greater or lesser degree A group does not\nreappear after it has once disappeared or its existence as long as it\nlasts is continuous I am aware that there are some apparent exceptions to\nthis rule but the exceptions are surprisingly few so few that E Forbes\nPictet and Woodward though all strongly opposed to such views as I\nmaintain admit its truth and the rule strictly accords with my theory\nFor as all the species of the same group have descended from some one\nspecies it is clear that as long as any species of the group have appeared\nin the long succession of ages so long must its members have continuously\nexisted in order to have generated either new and modified or the same old\nand unmodified forms Species of the genus Lingula for instance must have\ncontinuously existed by an unbroken succession of generations from the\nlowest Silurian stratum to the present day\n\nWe have seen in the last chapter that the species of a group sometimes\nfalsely appear to have come in abruptly and I have attempted to give an\nexplanation of this fact which if true would have been fatal to my views\nBut such cases are certainly exceptional the general rule being a gradual\nincrease in number till the group reaches its maximum and then sooner or\nlater it gradually decreases If the number of the species of a genus or\nthe number of 317 the genera of a family be represented by a vertical\nline of varying thickness crossing the successive geological formations in\nwhich the species are found the line will sometimes falsely appear to\nbegin at its lower end not in a sharp point but abruptly it then\ngradually thickens upwards sometimes keeping for a space of equal\nthickness and ultimately thins out in the upper beds marking the decrease\nand final extinction of the species This gradual increase in number of the\nspecies of a group is strictly conformable with my theory as the species\nof the same genus and the genera of the same family can increase only\nslowly and progressively for the process of modification and the\nproduction of a number of allied forms must be slow and gradualone\nspecies giving rise first to two or three varieties these being slowly\nconverted into species which in their turn produce by equally slow steps\nother species and so on like the branching of a great tree from a single\nstem till the group becomes large\n\n\n\nOn ExtinctionWe have as yet spoken only incidentally of the\ndisappearance of species and of groups of species On the theory of natural\nselection the extinction of old forms and the production of new and\nimproved forms are intimately connected together The old notion of all the\ninhabitants of the earth having been swept away at successive periods by\ncatastrophes is very generally given up even by those geologists as Elie\nde Beaumont Murchison Barrande c whose general views would naturally\nlead them to this conclusion On the contrary we have every reason to\nbelieve from the study of the tertiary formations that species and groups\nof species gradually disappear one after another first from one spot\nthen from another and finally from the world Both single species and\nwhole 318 groups of species last for very unequal periods some groups\nas we have seen having endured from the earliest known dawn of life to the\npresent day some having disappeared before the close of the palozoic\nperiod No fixed law seems to determine the length of time during which any\nsingle species or any single genus endures There is reason to believe that\nthe complete extinction of the species of a group is generally a slower\nprocess than their production: if the appearance and disappearance of a\ngroup of species be represented as before by a vertical line of varying\nthickness the line is found to taper more gradually at its upper end\nwhich marks the progress of extermination than at its lower end which\nmarks the first appearance and increase in numbers of the species In some\ncases however the extermination of whole groups of beings as of\nammonites towards the close of the secondary period has been wonderfully\nsudden\n\nThe whole subject of the extinction of species has been involved in the\nmost gratuitous mystery Some authors have even supposed that as the\nindividual has a definite length of life so have species a definite\nduration No one I think can have marvelled more at the extinction of\nspecies than I have done When I found in La Plata the tooth of a horse\nembedded with the remains of Mastodon Megatherium Toxodon and other\nextinct monsters which all coexisted with still living shells at a very\nlate geological period I was filled with astonishment for seeing that the\nhorse since its introduction by the Spaniards into South America has run\nwild over the whole country and has increased in numbers at an unparalleled\nrate I asked myself what could so recently have exterminated the former\nhorse under conditions of life apparently so favourable But how utterly\ngroundless was my astonishment 319 Professor Owen soon perceived that\nthe tooth though so like that of the existing horse belonged to an\nextinct species Had this horse been still living but in some degree rare\nno naturalist would have felt the least surprise at its rarity for rarity\nis the attribute of a vast number of species of all classes in all\ncountries If we ask ourselves why this or that species is rare we answer\nthat something is unfavourable in its conditions of life but what that\nsomething is we can hardly ever tell On the supposition of the fossil\nhorse still existing as a rare species we might have felt certain from the\nanalogy of all other mammals even of the slowbreeding elephant and from\nthe history of the naturalisation of the domestic horse in South America\nthat under more favourable conditions it would in a very few years have\nstocked the whole continent But we could not have told what the\nunfavourable conditions were which checked its increase whether some one\nor several contingencies and at what period of the horses life and in\nwhat degree they severally acted If the conditions had gone on however\nslowly becoming less and less favourable we assuredly should not have\nperceived the fact yet the fossil horse would certainly have become rarer\nand rarer and finally extinctits place being seized on by some more\nsuccessful competitor\n\nIt is most difficult always to remember that the increase of every living\nbeing is constantly being checked by unperceived injurious agencies and\nthat these same unperceived agencies are amply sufficient to cause rarity\nand finally extinction We see in many cases in the more recent tertiary\nformations that rarity precedes extinction and we know that this has been\nthe progress of events with those animals which have been exterminated\neither locally or wholly through 320 mans agency I may repeat what I\npublished in 1845 namely that to admit that species generally become rare\nbefore they become extinctto feel no surprise at the rarity of a species\nand yet to marvel greatly when it ceases to exist is much the same as to\nadmit that sickness in the individual is the forerunner of deathto feel\nno surprise at sickness but when the sick man dies to wonder and to\nsuspect that he died by some unknown deed of violence\n\nThe theory of natural selection is grounded on the belief that each new\nvariety and ultimately each new species is produced and maintained by\nhaving some advantage over those with which it comes into competition and\nthe consequent extinction of lessfavoured forms almost inevitably follows\nIt is the same with our domestic productions: when a new and slightly\nimproved variety has been raised it at first supplants the less improved\nvarieties in the same neighbourhood when much improved it is transported\nfar and near like our shorthorn cattle and takes the place of other\nbreeds in other countries Thus the appearance of new forms and the\ndisappearance of old forms both natural and artificial are bound\ntogether In certain flourishing groups the number of new specific forms\nwhich have been produced within a given time is probably greater than that\nof the old specific forms which have been exterminated but we know that\nthe number of species has not gone on indefinitely increasing at least\nduring the later geological periods so that looking to later times we may\nbelieve that the production of new forms has caused the extinction of about\nthe same number of old forms\n\nThe competition will generally be most severe as formerly explained and\nillustrated by examples between the forms which are most like each other\nin all respects 321 Hence the improved and modified descendants of a\nspecies will generally cause the extermination of the parentspecies and\nif many new forms have been developed from any one species the nearest\nallies of that species ie the species of the same genus will be the\nmost liable to extermination Thus as I believe a number of new species\ndescended from one species that is a new genus comes to supplant an old\ngenus belonging to the same family But it must often have happened that a\nnew species belonging to some one group will have seized on the place\noccupied by a species belonging to a distinct group and thus caused its\nextermination and if many allied forms be developed from the successful\nintruder many will have to yield their places and it will generally be\nallied forms which will suffer from some inherited inferiority in common\nBut whether it be species belonging to the same or to a distinct class\nwhich yield their places to other species which have been modified and\nimproved a few of the sufferers may often long be preserved from being\nfitted to some peculiar line of life or from inhabiting some distant and\nisolated station where they have escaped severe competition For instance\na single species of Trigonia a great genus of shells in the secondary\nformations survives in the Australian seas and a few members of the great\nand almost extinct group of Ganoid fishes still inhabit our fresh waters\nTherefore the utter extinction of a group is generally as we have seen a\nslower process than its production\n\nWith respect to the apparently sudden extermination of whole families or\norders as of Trilobites at the close of the palozoic period and of\nAmmonites at the close of the secondary period we must remember what has\nbeen already said on the probable wide intervals of time 322 between our\nconsecutive formations and in these intervals there may have been much\nslow extermination Moreover when by sudden immigration or by unusually\nrapid development many species of a new group have taken possession of a\nnew area they will have exterminated in a correspondingly rapid manner\nmany of the old inhabitants and the forms which thus yield their places\nwill commonly be allied for they will partake of some inferiority in\ncommon\n\nThus as it seems to me the manner in which single species and whole\ngroups of species become extinct accords well with the theory of natural\nselection We need not marvel at extinction if we must marvel let it be\nat our presumption in imagining for a moment that we understand the many\ncomplex contingencies on which the existence of each species depends If\nwe forget for an instant that each species tends to increase inordinately\nand that some check is always in action yet seldom perceived by us the\nwhole economy of nature will be utterly obscured Whenever we can precisely\nsay why this species is more abundant in individuals than that why this\nspecies and not another can be naturalised in a given country then and\nnot till then we may justly feel surprise why we cannot account for the\nextinction of this particular species or group of species\n\n\n\nOn the Forms of Life changing almost simultaneously throughout the\nWorldScarcely any palontological discovery is more striking than the\nfact that the forms of life change almost simultaneously throughout the\nworld Thus our European Chalk formation can be recognised in many distant\nparts of the world under the most different climates where not a fragment\nof the mineral chalk itself can be found namely in North 323 America\nin equatorial South America in Tierra del Fuego at the Cape of Good Hope\nand in the peninsula of India For at these distant points the organic\nremains in certain beds present an unmistakeable degree of resemblance to\nthose of the Chalk It is not that the same species are met with for in\nsome cases not one species is identically the same but they belong to the\nsame families genera and sections of genera and sometimes are similarly\ncharacterised in such trifling points as mere superficial sculpture\nMoreover other forms which are not found in the Chalk of Europe but which\noccur in the formations either above or below are similarly absent at\nthese distant points of the world In the several successive palozoic\nformations of Russia Western Europe and North America a similar\nparallelism in the forms of life has been observed by several authors: so\nit is according to Lyell with the several European and North American\ntertiary deposits Even if the few fossil species which are common to the\nOld and New Worlds be kept wholly out of view the general parallelism in\nthe successive forms of life in the stages of the widely separated\npalozoic and tertiary periods would still be manifest and the several\nformations could be easily correlated\n\nThese observations however relate to the marine inhabitants of distant\nparts of the world: we have not sufficient data to judge whether the\nproductions of the land and of fresh water change at distant points in the\nsame parallel manner We may doubt whether they have thus changed: if the\nMegatherium Mylodon Macrauchenia and Toxodon had been brought to Europe\nfrom La Plata without any information in regard to their geological\nposition no one would have suspected that they had coexisted with still\nliving seashells but as these anomalous monsters coexisted with the\n324 Mastodon and Horse it might at least have been inferred that they\nhad lived during one of the later tertiary stages\n\nWhen the marine forms of life are spoken of as having changed\nsimultaneously throughout the world it must not be supposed that this\nexpression relates to the same thousandth or hundredthousandth year or\neven that it has a very strict geological sense for if all the marine\nanimals which live at the present day in Europe and all those that lived\nin Europe during the pleistocene period an enormously remote period as\nmeasured by years including the whole glacial epoch were to be compared\nwith those now living in South America or in Australia the most skilful\nnaturalist would hardly be able to say whether the existing or the\npleistocene inhabitants of Europe resembled most closely those of the\nsouthern hemisphere So again several highly competent observers believe\nthat the existing productions of the United States are more closely related\nto those which lived in Europe during certain later tertiary stages than\nto those which now live here and if this be so it is evident that\nfossiliferous beds deposited at the present day on the shores of North\nAmerica would hereafter be liable to be classed with somewhat older\nEuropean beds Nevertheless looking to a remotely future epoch there can\nI think be little doubt that all the more modern marine formations\nnamely the upper pliocene the pleistocene and strictly modern beds of\nEurope North and South America and Australia from containing fossil\nremains in some degree allied and from not including those forms which are\nonly found in the older underlying deposits would be correctly ranked as\nsimultaneous in a geological sense\n\nThe fact of the forms of life changing simultaneously in the above large\nsense at distant parts of the world has greatly struck those admirable\nobservers MM 325 de Verneuil and dArchiac After referring to the\nparallelism of the palozoic forms of life in various parts of Europe they\nadd If struck by this strange sequence we turn our attention to North\nAmerica and there discover a series of analogous phenomena it will appear\ncertain that all these modifications of species their extinction and the\nintroduction of new ones cannot be owing to mere changes in marine\ncurrents or other causes more or less local and temporary but depend on\ngeneral laws which govern the whole animal kingdom M Barrande has made\nforcible remarks to precisely the same effect It is indeed quite futile\nto look to changes of currents climate or other physical conditions as\nthe cause of these great mutations in the forms of life throughout the\nworld under the most different climates We must as Barrande has\nremarked look to some special law We shall see this more clearly when we\ntreat of the present distribution of organic beings and find how slight is\nthe relation between the physical conditions of various countries and the\nnature of their inhabitants\n\nThis great fact of the parallel succession of the forms of life throughout\nthe world is explicable on the theory of natural selection New species\nare formed by new varieties arising which have some advantage over older\nforms and those forms which are already dominant or have some advantage\nover the other forms in their own country would naturally oftenest give\nrise to new varieties or incipient species for these latter must be\nvictorious in a still higher degree in order to be preserved and to\nsurvive We have distinct evidence on this head in the plants which are\ndominant that is which are commonest in their own homes and are most\nwidely diffused having produced the greatest number of new varieties It\nis also natural that the 326 dominant varying and farspreading\nspecies which already have invaded to a certain extent the territories of\nother species should be those which would have the best chance of\nspreading still further and of giving rise in new countries to new\nvarieties and species The process of diffusion may often be very slow\nbeing dependent on climatal and geographical changes or on strange\naccidents but in the long run the dominant forms will generally succeed in\nspreading The diffusion would it is probable be slower with the\nterrestrial inhabitants of distinct continents than with the marine\ninhabitants of the continuous sea We might therefore expect to find as we\napparently do find a less strict degree of parallel succession in the\nproductions of the land than of the sea\n\nDominant species spreading from any region might encounter still more\ndominant species and then their triumphant course or even their\nexistence would cease We know not at all precisely what are all the\nconditions most favourable for the multiplication of new and dominant\nspecies but we can I think clearly see that a number of individuals\nfrom giving a better chance of the appearance of favourable variations and\nthat severe competition with many already existing forms would be highly\nfavourable as would be the power of spreading into new territories A\ncertain amount of isolation recurring at long intervals of time would\nprobably be also favourable as before explained One quarter of the world\nmay have been most favourable for the production of new and dominant\nspecies on the land and another for those in the waters of the sea If two\ngreat regions had been for a long period favourably circumstanced in an\nequal degree whenever their inhabitants met the battle would be prolonged\nand severe and some from one birthplace and some from the other might be\nvictorious But in the course of time the 327 forms dominant in the\nhighest degree wherever produced would tend everywhere to prevail As\nthey prevailed they would cause the extinction of other and inferior\nforms and as these inferior forms would be allied in groups by\ninheritance whole groups would tend slowly to disappear though here and\nthere a single member might long be enabled to survive\n\nThus as it seems to me the parallel and taken in a large sense\nsimultaneous succession of the same forms of life throughout the world\naccords well with the principle of new species having been formed by\ndominant species spreading widely and varying the new species thus\nproduced being themselves dominant owing to inheritance and to having\nalready had some advantage over their parents or over other species these\nagain spreading varying and producing new species The forms which are\nbeaten and which yield their places to the new and victorious forms will\ngenerally be allied in groups from inheriting some inferiority in common\nand therefore as new and improved groups spread throughout the world old\ngroups will disappear from the world and the succession of forms in both\nways will everywhere tend to correspond\n\nThere is one other remark connected with this subject worth making I have\ngiven my reasons for believing that all our greater fossiliferous\nformations were deposited during periods of subsidence and that blank\nintervals of vast duration occurred during the periods when the bed of the\nsea was either stationary or rising and likewise when sediment was not\nthrown down quickly enough to embed and preserve organic remains During\nthese long and blank intervals I suppose that the inhabitants of each\nregion underwent a considerable amount of modification and extinction and\nthat there was much migration from 328 other parts of the world As we\nhave reason to believe that large areas are affected by the same movement\nit is probable that strictly contemporaneous formations have often been\naccumulated over very wide spaces in the same quarter of the world but we\nare far from having any right to conclude that this has invariably been the\ncase and that large areas have invariably been affected by the same\nmovements When two formations have been deposited in two regions during\nnearly but not exactly the same period we should find in both from the\ncauses explained in the foregoing paragraphs the same general succession\nin the forms of life but the species would not exactly correspond for\nthere will have been a little more time in the one region than in the other\nfor modification extinction and immigration\n\nI suspect that cases of this nature occur in Europe Mr Prestwich in his\nadmirable Memoirs on the eocene deposits of England and France is able to\ndraw a close general parallelism between the successive stages in the two\ncountries but when he compares certain stages in England with those in\nFrance although he finds in both a curious accordance in the numbers of\nthe species belonging to the same genera yet the species themselves differ\nin a manner very difficult to account for considering the proximity of the\ntwo areasunless indeed it be assumed that an isthmus separated two\nseas inhabited by distinct but contemporaneous faunas Lyell has made\nsimilar observations on some of the later tertiary formations Barrande\nalso shows that there is a striking general parallelism in the successive\nSilurian deposits of Bohemia and Scandinavia nevertheless he finds a\nsurprising amount of difference in the species If the several formations\nin these regions have not been deposited during the same exact 329\nperiodsa formation in one region often corresponding with a blank\ninterval in the otherand if in both regions the species have gone on\nslowly changing during the accumulation of the several formations and\nduring the long intervals of time between them in this case the several\nformations in the two regions could be arranged in the same order in\naccordance with the general succession of the form of life and the order\nwould falsely appear to be strictly parallel nevertheless the species\nwould not all be the same in the apparently corresponding stages in the two\nregions\n\n\n\nOn the Affinities of extinct Species to each other and to living\nformsLet us now look to the mutual affinities of extinct and living\nspecies They all fall into one grand natural system and this fact is at\nonce explained on the principle of descent The more ancient any form is\nthe more as a general rule it differs from living forms But as Buckland\nlong ago remarked all fossils can be classed either in still existing\ngroups or between them That the extinct forms of life help to fill up the\nwide intervals between existing genera families and orders cannot be\ndisputed For if we confine our attention either to the living or to the\nextinct alone the series is far less perfect than if we combine both into\none general system With respect to the Vertebrata whole pages could be\nfilled with striking illustrations from our great palaeontologist Owen\nshowing how extinct animals fall in between existing groups Cuvier ranked\nthe Ruminants and Pachyderms as the two most distinct orders of mammals\nbut Owen has discovered so many fossil links that he has had to alter the\nwhole classification of these two orders and has placed certain pachyderms\nin the same suborder with ruminants: for example he dissolves by fine\ngradations the apparently 330 wide difference between the pig and the\ncamel In regard to the Invertebrata Barrande and a higher authority\ncould not be named asserts that he is every day taught that Palaeozoic\nanimals though belonging to the same orders families or genera with\nthose living at the present day were not at this early epoch limited in\nsuch distinct groups as they now are\n\nSome writers have objected to any extinct species or group of species being\nconsidered as intermediate between living species or groups If by this\nterm it is meant that an extinct form is directly intermediate in all its\ncharacters between two living forms the objection is probably valid But I\napprehend that in a perfectly natural classification many fossil species\nwould have to stand between living species and some extinct genera between\nliving genera even between genera belonging to distinct families The most\ncommon case especially with respect to very distinct groups such as fish\nand reptiles seems to be that supposing them to be distinguished at the\npresent day from each other by a dozen characters the ancient members of\nthe same two groups would be distinguished by a somewhat lesser number of\ncharacters so that the two groups though formerly quite distinct at that\nperiod made some small approach to each other\n\nIt is a common belief that the more ancient a form is by so much the more\nit tends to connect by some of its characters groups now widely separated\nfrom each other This remark no doubt must be restricted to those groups\nwhich have undergone much change in the course of geological ages and it\nwould be difficult to prove the truth of the proposition for every now and\nthen even a living animal as the Lepidosiren is discovered having\naffinities directed towards very distinct groups Yet if we compare the\nolder Reptiles and 331 Batrachians the older Fish the older\nCephalopods and the eocene Mammals with the more recent members of the\nsame classes we must admit that there is some truth in the remark\n\nLet us see how far these several facts and inferences accord with the\ntheory of descent with modification As the subject is somewhat complex I\nmust request the reader to turn to the diagram in the fourth chapter We\nmay suppose that the numbered letters represent genera and the dotted\nlines diverging from them the species in each genus The diagram is much\ntoo simple too few genera and too few species being given but this is\nunimportant for us The horizontal lines may represent successive\ngeological formations and all the forms beneath the uppermost line may be\nconsidered as extinct The three existing genera a14 q14 p14\nwill form a small family b14 and f14 a closely allied family or\nsubfamily and o14 e14 m14 a third family These three\nfamilies together with the many extinct genera on the several lines of\ndescent diverging from the parentform A will form an order for all\nwill have inherited something in common from their ancient and common\nprogenitor On the principle of the continued tendency to divergence of\ncharacter which was formerly illustrated by this diagram the more recent\nany form is the more it will generally differ from its ancient progenitor\nHence we can understand the rule that the most ancient fossils differ most\nfrom existing forms We must not however assume that divergence of\ncharacter is a necessary contingency it depends solely on the descendants\nfrom a species being thus enabled to seize on many and different places in\nthe economy of nature Therefore it is quite possible as we have seen in\nthe case of some Silurian forms that a species might go on being slightly\nmodified in relation to its slightly altered conditions of 332 life and\nyet retain throughout a vast period the same general characteristics This\nis represented in the diagram by the letter F14\n\nAll the many forms extinct and recent descended from A make as before\nremarked one order and this order from the continued effects of\nextinction and divergence of character has become divided into several\nsubfamilies and families some of which are supposed to have perished at\ndifferent periods and some to have endured to the present day\n\nBy looking at the diagram we can see that if many of the extinct forms\nsupposed to be embedded in the successive formations were discovered at\nseveral points low down in the series the three existing families on the\nuppermost line would be rendered less distinct from each other If for\ninstance the genera a1 a5 a10 f8 m3 m6 m9 were\ndisinterred these three families would be so closely linked together that\nthey probably would have to be united into one great family in nearly the\nsame manner as has occurred with ruminants and pachyderms Yet he who\nobjected to call the extinct genera which thus linked the living genera of\nthree families together intermediate in character would be justified as\nthey are intermediate not directly but only by a long and circuitous\ncourse through many widely different forms If many extinct forms were to\nbe discovered above one of the middle horizontal lines or geological\nformations for instance above No VIbut none from beneath this line\nthen only the two families on the left hand namely a14 c and\nb14c would have to be united into one family and the two other\nfamilies namely a14 to f14 now including five genera and o14 to\nm14 would yet remain distinct These two families however would be\nless distinct from each other than they were before the discovery of the\nfossils If for instance we suppose the existing genera of the two\nfamilies to differ from each 333 other by a dozen characters in this\ncase the genera at the early period marked VI would differ by a lesser\nnumber of characters for at this early stage of descent they have not\ndiverged in character from the common progenitor of the order nearly so\nmuch as they subsequently diverged Thus it comes that ancient and extinct\ngenera are often in some slight degree intermediate in character between\ntheir modified descendants or between their collateral relations\n\nIn nature the case will be far more complicated than is represented in the\ndiagram for the groups will have been more numerous they will have\nendured for extremely unequal lengths of time and will have been modified\nin various degrees As we possess only the last volume of the geological\nrecord and that in a very broken condition we have no right to expect\nexcept in very rare cases to fill up wide intervals in the natural system\nand thus unite distinct families or orders All that we have a right to\nexpect is that those groups which have within known geological periods\nundergone much modification should in the older formations make some\nslight approach to each other so that the older members should differ less\nfrom each other in some of their characters than do the existing members of\nthe same groups and this by the concurrent evidence of our best\npalontologists seems frequently to be the case\n\nThus on the theory of descent with modification the main facts with\nrespect to the mutual affinities of the extinct forms of life to each other\nand to living forms seem to me explained in a satisfactory manner And\nthey are wholly inexplicable on any other view\n\nOn this same theory it is evident that the fauna of any great period in\nthe earths history will be intermediate in general character between that\nwhich preceded and that which succeeded it Thus the species which lived\nat the sixth great stage of descent in the 334 diagram are the modified\noffspring of those which lived at the fifth stage and are the parents of\nthose which became still more modified at the seventh stage hence they\ncould hardly fail to be nearly intermediate in character between the forms\nof life above and below We must however allow for the entire extinction\nof some preceding forms and in any one region for the immigration of new\nforms from other regions and for a large amount of modification during\nthe long and blank intervals between the successive formations Subject to\nthese allowances the fauna of each geological period undoubtedly is\nintermediate in character between the preceding and succeeding faunas I\nneed give only one instance namely the manner in which the fossils of the\nDevonian system when this system was first discovered were at once\nrecognised by palontologists as intermediate in character between those of\nthe overlying carboniferous and underlying Silurian system But each fauna\nis not necessarily exactly intermediate as unequal intervals of time have\nelapsed between consecutive formations\n\nIt is no real objection to the truth of the statement that the fauna of\neach period as a whole is nearly intermediate in character between the\npreceding and succeeding faunas that certain genera offer exceptions to\nthe rule For instance mastodons and elephants when arranged by Dr\nFalconer in two series first according to their mutual affinities and then\naccording to their periods of existence do not accord in arrangement The\nspecies extreme in character are not the oldest or the most recent nor\nare those which are intermediate in character intermediate in age But\nsupposing for an instant in this and other such cases that the record of\nthe first appearance and disappearance of the species was perfect we have\nno reason to believe that forms successively produced necessarily endure\nfor 335 corresponding lengths of time: a very ancient form might\noccasionally last much longer than a form elsewhere subsequently produced\nespecially in the case of terrestrial productions inhabiting separated\ndistricts To compare small things with great: if the principal living and\nextinct races of the domestic pigeon were arranged as well as they could be\nin serial affinity this arrangement would not closely accord with the\norder in time of their production and still less with the order of their\ndisappearance for the parent rockpigeon now lives and many varieties\nbetween the rockpigeon and the carrier have become extinct and carriers\nwhich are extreme in the important character of length of beak originated\nearlier than shortbeaked tumblers which are at the opposite end of the\nseries in this same respect\n\nClosely connected with the statement that the organic remains from an\nintermediate formation are in some degree intermediate in character is the\nfact insisted on by all palontologists that fossils from two consecutive\nformations are far more closely related to each other than are the fossils\nfrom two remote formations Pictet gives as a wellknown instance the\ngeneral resemblance of the organic remains from the several stages of the\nChalk formation though the species are distinct in each stage This fact\nalone from its generality seems to have shaken Professor Pictet in his\nfirm belief in the immutability of species He who is acquainted with the\ndistribution of existing species over the globe will not attempt to\naccount for the close resemblance of the distinct species in closely\nconsecutive formations by the physical conditions of the ancient areas\nhaving remained nearly the same Let it be remembered that the forms of\nlife at least those inhabiting the sea have changed almost simultaneously\nthroughout the world and therefore under the most different climates and\nconditions Consider the 336 prodigious vicissitudes of climate during\nthe pleistocene period which includes the whole glacial period and note\nhow little the specific forms of the inhabitants of the sea have been\naffected\n\nOn the theory of descent the full meaning of the fact of fossil remains\nfrom closely consecutive formations though ranked as distinct species\nbeing closely related is obvious As the accumulation of each formation\nhas often been interrupted and as long blank intervals have intervened\nbetween successive formations we ought not to expect to find as I\nattempted to show in the last chapter in any one or two formations all the\nintermediate varieties between the species which appeared at the\ncommencement and close of these periods but we ought to find after\nintervals very long as measured by years but only moderately long as\nmeasured geologically closely allied forms or as they have been called\nby some authors representative species and these we assuredly do find We\nfind in short such evidence of the slow and scarcely sensible mutation of\nspecific forms as we have a just right to expect to find\n\n\n\nOn the state of Development of Ancient FormsThere has been much\ndiscussion whether recent forms are more highly developed than ancient I\nwill not here enter on this subject for naturalists have not as yet\ndefined to each others satisfaction what is meant by high and low forms\nThe best definition probably is that the higher forms have their organs\nmore distinctly specialised for different functions and as such division\nof physiological labour seems to be an advantage to each being natural\nselection will constantly tend in so far to make the later and more\nmodified forms higher than their early progenitors or than the slightly\nmodified descendants of such progenitors In a more general sense the 337\nmore recent forms must on my theory be higher than the more ancient for\neach new species is formed by having had some advantage in the struggle for\nlife over other and preceding forms If under a nearly similar climate the\neocene inhabitants of one quarter of the world were put into competition\nwith the existing inhabitants of the same or some other quarter the eocene\nfauna or flora would certainly be beaten and exterminated as would a\nsecondary fauna by an eocene and a palozoic fauna by a secondary fauna I\ndo not doubt that this process of improvement has affected in a marked and\nsensible manner the organisation of the more recent and victorious forms of\nlife in comparison with the ancient and beaten forms but I can see no way\nof testing this sort of progress Crustaceans for instance not the\nhighest in their own class may have beaten the highest molluscs From the\nextraordinary manner in which European productions have recently spread\nover New Zealand and have seized on places which must have been previously\noccupied we may believe if all the animals and plants of Great Britain\nwere set free in New Zealand that in the course of time a multitude of\nBritish forms would become thoroughly naturalized there and would\nexterminate many of the natives On the other hand from what we see now\noccurring in New Zealand and from hardly a single inhabitant of the\nsouthern hemisphere having become wild in any part of Europe we may doubt\nif all the productions of New Zealand were set free in Great Britain\nwhether any considerable number would be enabled to seize on places now\noccupied by our native plants and animals Under this point of view the\nproductions of Great Britain may be said to be higher than those of New\nZealand Yet the most skilful naturalist from an examination of the 338\nspecies of the two countries could not have foreseen this result\n\nAgassiz insists that ancient animals resemble to a certain extent the\nembryos of recent animals of the same classes or that the geological\nsuccession of extinct forms is in some degree parallel to the embryological\ndevelopment of recent forms I must follow Pictet and Huxley in thinking\nthat the truth of this doctrine is very far from proved Yet I fully expect\nto see it hereafter confirmed at least in regard to subordinate groups\nwhich have branched off from each other within comparatively recent times\nFor this doctrine of Agassiz accords well with the theory of natural\nselection In a future chapter I shall attempt to show that the adult\ndiffers from its embryo owing to variations supervening at a not early\nage and being inherited at a corresponding age This process whilst it\nleaves the embryo almost unaltered continually adds in the course of\nsuccessive generations more and more difference to the adult\n\nThus the embryo comes to be left as a sort of picture preserved by nature\nof the ancient and less modified condition of each animal This view may be\ntrue and yet it may never be capable of full proof Seeing for instance\nthat the oldest known mammals reptiles and fish strictly belong to their\nown proper classes though some of these old forms are in a slight degree\nless distinct from each other than are the typical members of the same\ngroups at the present day it would be vain to look for animals having the\ncommon embryological character of the Vertebrata until beds far beneath\nthe lowest Silurian strata are discovereda discovery of which the chance\nis very small\n\n\n\nOn the Succession of the same Types within the same 339 areas during\nthe later tertiary periodsMr Clift many years ago showed that the\nfossil mammals from the Australian caves were closely allied to the living\nmarsupials of that continent In South America a similar relationship is\nmanifest even to an uneducated eye in the gigantic pieces of armour like\nthose of the armadillo found in several parts of La Plata and Professor\nOwen has shown in the most striking manner that most of the fossil mammals\nburied there in such numbers are related to South American types This\nrelationship is even more clearly seen in the wonderful collection of\nfossil bones made by MM Lund and Clausen in the caves of Brazil I was so\nmuch impressed with these facts that I strongly insisted in 1839 and 1845\non this law of the succession of typeson this wonderful relationship\nin the same continent between the dead and the living Professor Owen has\nsubsequently extended the same generalisation to the mammals of the Old\nWorld We see the same law in this authors restorations of the extinct and\ngigantic birds of New Zealand We see it also in the birds of the caves of\nBrazil Mr Woodward has shown that the same law holds good with\nseashells but from the wide distribution of most genera of molluscs it\nis not well displayed by them Other cases could be added as the relation\nbetween the extinct and living landshells of Madeira and between the\nextinct and living brackishwater shells of the AraloCaspian Sea\n\nNow what does this remarkable law of the succession of the same types\nwithin the same areas mean He would be a bold man who after comparing the\npresent climate of Australia and of parts of South America under the same\nlatitude would attempt to account on the one hand by dissimilar physical\nconditions for the dissimilarity of the inhabitants of these two\ncontinents 340 and on the other hand by similarity of conditions for\nthe uniformity of the same types in each during the later tertiary periods\nNor can it be pretended that it is an immutable law that marsupials should\nhave been chiefly or solely produced in Australia or that Edentata and\nother American types should have been solely produced in South America For\nwe know that Europe in ancient times was peopled by numerous marsupials\nand I have shown in the publications above alluded to that in America the\nlaw of distribution of terrestrial mammals was formerly different from what\nit now is North America formerly partook strongly of the present character\nof the southern half of the continent and the southern half was formerly\nmore closely allied than it is at present to the northern half In a\nsimilar manner we know from Falconer and Cautleys discoveries that\nnorthern India was formerly more closely related in its mammals to Africa\nthan it is at the present time Analogous facts could be given in relation\nto the distribution of marine animals\n\nOn the theory of descent with modification the great law of the long\nenduring but not immutable succession of the same types within the same\nareas is at once explained for the inhabitants of each quarter of the\nworld will obviously tend to leave in that quarter during the next\nsucceeding period of time closely allied though in some degree modified\ndescendants If the inhabitants of one continent formerly differed greatly\nfrom those of another continent so will their modified descendants still\ndiffer in nearly the same manner and degree But after very long intervals\nof time and after great geographical changes permitting much\nintermigration the feebler will yield to the more dominant forms and\nthere will be nothing immutable in the laws of past and present\ndistribution 341\n\nIt may be asked in ridicule whether I suppose that the megatherium and\nother allied huge monsters have left behind them in South America the\nsloth armadillo and anteater as their degenerate descendants This\ncannot for an instant be admitted These huge animals have become wholly\nextinct and have left no progeny But in the caves of Brazil there are\nmany extinct species which are closely allied in size and in other\ncharacters to the species still living in South America and some of these\nfossils may be the actual progenitors of living species It must not be\nforgotten that on my theory all the species of the same genus have\ndescended from some one species so that if six genera each having eight\nspecies be found in one geological formation and in the next succeeding\nformation there be six other allied or representative genera with the same\nnumber of species then we may conclude that only one species of each of\nthe six older genera has left modified descendants constituting the six\nnew genera The other seven species of the old genera have all died out and\nhave left no progeny Or which would probably be a far commoner case two\nor three species of two or three alone of the six older genera will have\nbeen the parents of the six new genera the other old species and the other\nwhole old genera having become utterly extinct In failing orders with the\ngenera and species decreasing in numbers as apparently is the case of the\nEdentata of South America still fewer genera and species will have left\nmodified blooddescendants\n\n\n\nSummary of the preceding and present ChaptersI have attempted to show\nthat the geological record is extremely imperfect that only a small\nportion of the globe has been geologically explored with care that 342\nonly certain classes of organic beings have been largely preserved in a\nfossil state that the number both of specimens and of species preserved\nin our museums is absolutely as nothing compared with the incalculable\nnumber of generations which must have passed away even during a single\nformation that owing to subsidence being necessary for the accumulation\nof fossiliferous deposits thick enough to resist future degradation\nenormous intervals of time have elapsed between the successive formations\nthat there has probably been more extinction during the periods of\nsubsidence and more variation during the periods of elevation and during\nthe latter the record will have been least perfectly kept that each single\nformation has not been continuously deposited that the duration of each\nformation is perhaps short compared with the average duration of specific\nforms that migration has played an important part in the first appearance\nof new forms in any one area and formation that widely ranging species are\nthose which have varied most and have oftenest given rise to new species\nand that varieties have at first often been local All these causes taken\nconjointly must have tended to make the geological record extremely\nimperfect and will to a large extent explain why we do not find\ninterminable varieties connecting together all the extinct and existing\nforms of life by the finest graduated steps\n\nHe who rejects these views on the nature of the geological record will\nrightly reject my whole theory For he may ask in vain where are the\nnumberless transitional links which must formerly have connected the\nclosely allied or representative species found in the several stages of\nthe same great formation He may disbelieve in the enormous intervals of\ntime which have elapsed between our consecutive formations he 343 may\noverlook how important a part migration must have played when the\nformations of any one great region alone as that of Europe are\nconsidered he may urge the apparent but often falsely apparent sudden\ncoming in of whole groups of species He may ask where are the remains of\nthose infinitely numerous organisms which must have existed long before the\nfirst bed of the Silurian system was deposited: I can answer this latter\nquestion only hypothetically by saying that as far as we can see where\nour oceans now extend they have for an enormous period extended and where\nour oscillating continents now stand they have stood ever since the\nSilurian epoch but that long before that period the world may have\npresented a wholly different aspect and that the older continents formed\nof formations older than any known to us may now all be in a metamorphosed\ncondition or may lie buried under the ocean\n\nPassing from these difficulties all the other great leading facts in\npalontology seem to me simply to follow on the theory of descent with\nmodification through natural selection We can thus understand how it is\nthat new species come in slowly and successively how species of different\nclasses do not necessarily change together or at the same rate or in the\nsame degree yet in the long run that all undergo modification to some\nextent The extinction of old forms is the almost inevitable consequence of\nthe production of new forms We can understand why when a species has once\ndisappeared it never reappears Groups of species increase in numbers\nslowly and endure for unequal periods of time for the process of\nmodification is necessarily slow and depends on many complex\ncontingencies The dominant species of the larger dominant groups tend to\nleave many modified 344 descendants and thus new subgroups and groups\nare formed As these are formed the species of the less vigorous groups\nfrom their inferiority inherited from a common progenitor tend to become\nextinct together and to leave no modified offspring on the face of the\nearth But the utter extinction of a whole group of species may often be a\nvery slow process from the survival of a few descendants lingering in\nprotected and isolated situations When a group has once wholly\ndisappeared it does not reappear for the link of generation has been\nbroken\n\nWe can understand how the spreading of the dominant forms of life which\nare those that oftenest vary will in the long run tend to people the world\nwith allied but modified descendants and these will generally succeed in\ntaking the places of those groups of species which are their inferiors in\nthe struggle for existence Hence after long intervals of time the\nproductions of the world will appear to have changed simultaneously\n\nWe can understand how it is that all the forms of life ancient and recent\nmake together one grand system for all are connected by generation We can\nunderstand from the continued tendency to divergence of character why the\nmore ancient a form is the more it generally differs from those now\nliving Why ancient and extinct forms often tend to fill up gaps between\nexisting forms sometimes blending two groups previously classed as\ndistinct into one but more commonly only bringing them a little closer\ntogether The more ancient a form is the more often apparently it\ndisplays characters in some degree intermediate between groups now\ndistinct for the more ancient a form is the more nearly it will be\nrelated to and consequently resemble the common progenitor of groups\nsince 345 become widely divergent Extinct forms are seldom directly\nintermediate between existing forms but are intermediate only by a long\nand circuitous course through many extinct and very different forms We can\nclearly see why the organic remains of closely consecutive formations are\nmore closely allied to each other than are those of remote formations for\nthe forms are more closely linked together by generation: we can clearly\nsee why the remains of an intermediate formation are intermediate in\ncharacter\n\nThe inhabitants of each successive period in the worlds history have\nbeaten their predecessors in the race for life and are in so far higher\nin the scale of nature and this may account for that vague yet illdefined\nsentiment felt by many palontologists that organisation on the whole has\nprogressed If it should hereafter be proved that ancient animals resemble\nto a certain extent the embryos of more recent animals of the same class\nthe fact will be intelligible The succession of the same types of\nstructure within the same areas during the later geological periods ceases\nto be mysterious and is simply explained by inheritance\n\nIf then the geological record be as imperfect as I believe it to be and it\nmay at least be asserted that the record cannot be proved to be much more\nperfect the main objections to the theory of natural selection are greatly\ndiminished or disappear On the other hand all the chief laws of\npalontology plainly proclaim as it seems to me that species have been\nproduced by ordinary generation: old forms having been supplanted by new\nand improved forms of life produced by the laws of variation still acting\nround us and preserved by Natural Selection\n\n                                   \n\n\n346\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nGEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\n\n    Present distribution cannot be accounted for by differences in physical\n    conditionsImportance of barriersAffinity of the productions of the\n    same continentCentres of creationMeans of dispersal by changes of\n    climate and of the level of the land and by occasional\n    meansDispersal during the Glacial period coextensive with the world\n\nIn considering the distribution of organic beings over the face of the\nglobe the first great fact which strikes us is that neither the\nsimilarity nor the dissimilarity of the inhabitants of various regions can\nbe accounted for by their climatal and other physical conditions Of late\nalmost every author who has studied the subject has come to this\nconclusion The case of America alone would almost suffice to prove its\ntruth: for if we exclude the northern parts where the circumpolar land is\nalmost continuous all authors agree that one of the most fundamental\ndivisions in geographical distribution is that between the New and Old\nWorlds yet if we travel over the vast American continent from the central\nparts of the United States to its extreme southern point we meet with the\nmost diversified conditions the most humid districts arid deserts lofty\nmountains grassy plains forests marshes lakes and great rivers under\nalmost every temperature There is hardly a climate or condition in the Old\nWorld which cannot be paralleled in the Newat least as closely as the\nsame species generally require for it is a most rare case to find a group\nof organisms confined to any small spot having conditions peculiar in only\na slight 347 degree for instance small areas in the Old World could be\npointed out hotter than any in the New World yet these are not inhabited\nby a peculiar fauna or flora Notwithstanding this parallelism in the\nconditions of the Old and New Worlds how widely different are their living\nproductions\n\nIn the southern hemisphere if we compare large tracts of land in\nAustralia South Africa and western South America between latitudes 25\nand 35 we shall find parts extremely similar in all their conditions yet\nit would not be possible to point out three faunas and floras more utterly\ndissimilar Or again we may compare the productions of South America south\nof lat 35 with those north of 25 which consequently inhabit a\nconsiderably different climate and they will be found incomparably more\nclosely related to each other than they are to the productions of\nAustralia or Africa under nearly the same climate Analogous facts could be\ngiven with respect to the inhabitants of the sea\n\nA second great fact which strikes us in our general review is that\nbarriers of any kind or obstacles to free migration are related in a\nclose and important manner to the differences between the productions of\nvarious regions We see this in the great difference of nearly all the\nterrestrial productions of the New and Old Worlds excepting in the\nnorthern parts where the land almost joins and where under a slightly\ndifferent climate there might have been free migration for the northern\ntemperate forms as there now is for the strictly arctic productions We\nsee the same fact in the great difference between the inhabitants of\nAustralia Africa and South America under the same latitude: for these\ncountries are almost as much isolated from each other as is possible On\neach continent also we see the same fact for on the opposite sides of\n348 lofty and continuous mountainranges and of great deserts and\nsometimes even of large rivers we find different productions though as\nmountainchains deserts c are not as impassable or likely to have\nendured so long as the oceans separating continents the differences are\nvery inferior in degree to those characteristic of distinct continents\n\nTurning to the sea we find the same law No two marine faunas are more\ndistinct with hardly a fish shell or crab in common than those of the\neastern and western shores of South and Central America yet these great\nfaunas are separated only by the narrow but impassable isthmus of Panama\nWestward of the shores of America a wide space of open ocean extends with\nnot an island as a haltingplace for emigrants here we have a barrier of\nanother kind and as soon as this is passed we meet in the eastern islands\nof the Pacific with another and totally distinct fauna So that here three\nmarine faunas range far northward and southward in parallel lines not far\nfrom each other under corresponding climates but from being separated\nfrom each other by impassable barriers either of land or open sea they\nare wholly distinct On the other hand proceeding still further westward\nfrom the eastern islands of the tropical parts of the Pacific we encounter\nno impassable barriers and we have innumerable islands as haltingplaces\nor continuous coasts until after travelling over a hemisphere we come to\nthe shores of Africa and over this vast space we meet with no welldefined\nand distinct marine faunas Although hardly one shell crab or fish is\ncommon to the abovenamed three approximate faunas of Eastern and Western\nAmerica and the eastern Pacific islands yet many fish range from the\nPacific into the Indian Ocean and many shells are common to the eastern\nislands of the Pacific 349 and the eastern shores of Africa on almost\nexactly opposite meridians of longitude\n\nA third great fact partly included in the foregoing statements is the\naffinity of the productions of the same continent or sea though the\nspecies themselves are distinct at different points and stations It is a\nlaw of the widest generality and every continent offers innumerable\ninstances Nevertheless the naturalist in travelling for instance from\nnorth to south never fails to be struck by the manner in which successive\ngroups of beings specifically distinct yet clearly related replace each\nother He hears from closely allied yet distinct kinds of birds notes\nnearly similar and sees their nests similarly constructed but not quite\nalike with eggs coloured in nearly the same manner The plains near the\nStraits of Magellan are inhabited by one species of Rhea American\nostrich and northward the plains of La Plata by another species of the\nsame genus and not by a true ostrich or emu like those found in Africa\nand Australia under the same latitude On these same plains of La Plata we\nsee the agouti and bizcacha animals having nearly the same habits as our\nhares and rabbits and belonging to the same order of Rodents but they\nplainly display an American type of structure We ascend the lofty peaks of\nthe Cordillera and we find an alpine species of bizcacha we look to the\nwaters and we do not find the beaver or muskrat but the coypu and\ncapybara rodents of the American type Innumerable other instances could\nbe given If we look to the islands off the American shore however much\nthey may differ in geological structure the inhabitants though they may\nbe all peculiar species are essentially American We may look back to past\nages as shown in the last chapter and we find American types then\nprevalent on 350 the American continent and in the American seas We see\nin these facts some deep organic bond prevailing throughout space and\ntime over the same areas of land and water and independent of their\nphysical conditions The naturalist must feel little curiosity who is not\nled to inquire what this bond is\n\nThis bond on my theory is simply inheritance that cause which alone as\nfar as we positively know produces organisms quite like or as we see in\nthe case of varieties nearly like each other The dissimilarity of the\ninhabitants of different regions may be attributed to modification through\nnatural selection and in a quite subordinate degree to the direct\ninfluence of different physical conditions The degree of dissimilarity\nwill depend on the migration of the more dominant forms of life from one\nregion into another having been effected with more or less ease at periods\nmore or less remoteon the nature and number of the former\nimmigrantsand on their action and reaction in their mutual struggles\nfor lifethe relation of organism to organism being as I have already\noften remarked the most important of all relations Thus the high\nimportance of barriers comes into play by checking migration as does time\nfor the slow process of modification through natural selection\nWidelyranging species abounding in individuals which have already\ntriumphed over many competitors in their own widelyextended homes will\nhave the best chance of seizing on new places when they spread into new\ncountries In their new homes they will be exposed to new conditions and\nwill frequently undergo further modification and improvement and thus they\nwill become still further victorious and will produce groups of modified\ndescendants On this principle of inheritance with modification we can\nunderstand how it is that sections of genera whole genera 351 and even\nfamilies are confined to the same areas as is so commonly and notoriously\nthe case\n\nI believe as was remarked in the last chapter in no law of necessary\ndevelopment As the variability of each species is an independent property\nand will be taken advantage of by natural selection only so far as it\nprofits the individual in its complex struggle for life so the degree of\nmodification in different species will be no uniform quantity If for\ninstance a number of species which stand in direct competition with each\nother migrate in a body into a new and afterwards isolated country they\nwill be little liable to modification for neither migration nor isolation\nin themselves can do anything These principles come into play only by\nbringing organisms into new relations with each other and in a lesser\ndegree with the surrounding physical conditions As we have seen in the\nlast chapter that some forms have retained nearly the same character from\nan enormously remote geological period so certain species have migrated\nover vast spaces and have not become greatly modified\n\nOn these views it is obvious that the several species of the same genus\nthough inhabiting the most distant quarters of the world must originally\nhave proceeded from the same source as they have descended from the same\nprogenitor In the case of those species which have undergone during whole\ngeological periods but little modification there is not much difficulty in\nbelieving that they may have migrated from the same region for during the\nvast geographical and climatal changes which will have supervened since\nancient times almost any amount of migration is possible But in many\nother cases in which we have reason to believe that the species of a genus\nhave been produced within comparatively recent times there is great\ndifficulty on this head It 352 is also obvious that the individuals of\nthe same species though now inhabiting distant and isolated regions must\nhave proceeded from one spot where their parents were first produced: for\nas explained in the last chapter it is incredible that individuals\nidentically the same should ever have been produced through natural\nselection from parents specifically distinct\n\nWe are thus brought to the question which has been largely discussed by\nnaturalists namely whether species have been created at one or more\npoints of the earths surface Undoubtedly there are very many cases of\nextreme difficulty in understanding how the same species could possibly\nhave migrated from some one point to the several distant and isolated\npoints where now found Nevertheless the simplicity of the view that each\nspecies was first produced within a single region captivates the mind He\nwho rejects it rejects the vera causa of ordinary generation with\nsubsequent migration and calls in the agency of a miracle It is\nuniversally admitted that in most cases the area inhabited by a species is\ncontinuous and when a plant or animal inhabits two points so distant from\neach other or with an interval of such a nature that the space could not\nbe easily passed over by migration the fact is given as something\nremarkable and exceptional The capacity of migrating across the sea is\nmore distinctly limited in terrestrial mammals than perhaps in any other\norganic beings and accordingly we find no inexplicable cases of the same\nmammal inhabiting distant points of the world No geologist will feel any\ndifficulty in such cases as Great Britain having been formerly united to\nEurope and consequently possessing the same quadrupeds But if the same\nspecies can be produced at two separate points why do we not find a single\nmammal common to Europe and 353 Australia or South America The\nconditions of life are nearly the same so that a multitude of European\nanimals and plants have become naturalised in America and Australia and\nsome of the aboriginal plants are identically the same at these distant\npoints of the northern and southern hemispheres The answer as I believe\nis that mammals have not been able to migrate whereas some plants from\ntheir varied means of dispersal have migrated across the vast and broken\ninterspace The great and striking influence which barriers of every kind\nhave had on distribution is intelligible only on the view that the great\nmajority of species have been produced on one side alone and have not been\nable to migrate to the other side Some few families many subfamilies\nvery many genera and a still greater number of sections of genera are\nconfined to a single region and it has been observed by several\nnaturalists that the most natural genera or those genera in which the\nspecies are most closely related to each other are generally local or\nconfined to one area What a strange anomaly it would be if when coming\none step lower in the series to the individuals of the same species a\ndirectly opposite rule prevailed and species were not local but had been\nproduced in two or more distinct areas\n\nHence it seems to me as it has to many other naturalists that the view of\neach species having been produced in one area alone and having\nsubsequently migrated from that area as far as its powers of migration and\nsubsistence under past and present conditions permitted is the most\nprobable Undoubtedly many cases occur in which we cannot explain how the\nsame species could have passed from one point to the other But the\ngeographical and climatal changes which have certainly occurred within\nrecent geological times must have interrupted or rendered discontinuous\nthe 354 formerly continuous range of many species So that we are reduced\nto consider whether the exceptions to continuity of range are so numerous\nand of so grave a nature that we ought to give up the belief rendered\nprobable by general considerations that each species has been produced\nwithin one area and has migrated thence as far as it could It would be\nhopelessly tedious to discuss all the exceptional cases of the same\nspecies now living at distant and separated points nor do I for a moment\npretend that any explanation could be offered of many such cases But after\nsome preliminary remarks I will discuss a few of the most striking classes\nof facts namely the existence of the same species on the summits of\ndistant mountainranges and at distant points in the arctic and antarctic\nregions and secondly in the following chapter the wide distribution of\nfreshwater productions and thirdly the occurrence of the same terrestrial\nspecies on islands and on the mainland though separated by hundreds of\nmiles of open sea If the existence of the same species at distant and\nisolated points of the earths surface can in many instances be explained\non the view of each species having migrated from a single birthplace then\nconsidering our ignorance with respect to former climatal and geographical\nchanges and various occasional means of transport the belief that this has\nbeen the universal law seems to me incomparably the safest\n\nIn discussing this subject we shall be enabled at the same time to\nconsider a point equally important for us namely whether the several\ndistinct species of a genus which on my theory have all descended from a\ncommon progenitor can have migrated undergoing modification during some\npart of their migration from the area inhabited by their progenitor If it\ncan be shown to be almost invariably the case that a region of which\n355 most of its inhabitants are closely related to or belong to the same\ngenera with the species of a second region has probably received at some\nformer period immigrants from this other region my theory will be\nstrengthened for we can clearly understand on the principle of\nmodification why the inhabitants of a region should be related to those of\nanother region whence it has been stocked A volcanic island for\ninstance upheaved and formed at the distance of a few hundreds of miles\nfrom a continent would probably receive from it in the course of time a\nfew colonists and their descendants though modified would still be\nplainly related by inheritance to the inhabitants of the continent Cases\nof this nature are common and are as we shall hereafter more fully see\ninexplicable on the theory of independent creation This view of the\nrelation of species in one region to those in another does not differ much\nby substituting the word variety for species from that lately advanced in\nan ingenious paper by Mr Wallace in which he concludes that every\nspecies has come into existence coincident both in space and time with a\npreexisting closely allied species And I now know from correspondence\nthat this coincidence he attributes to generation with modification\n\nThe previous remarks on single and multiple centres of creation do not\ndirectly bear on another allied questionnamely whether all the\nindividuals of the same species have descended from a single pair or\nsingle hermaphrodite or whether as some authors suppose from many\nindividuals simultaneously created With those organic beings which never\nintercross if such exist the species on my theory must have descended\nfrom a succession of improved varieties which will never have blended with\nother individuals or varieties but will have supplanted each other so\nthat at each 356 successive stage of modification and improvement all\nthe individuals of each variety will have descended from a single parent\nBut in the majority of cases namely with all organisms which habitually\nunite for each birth or which often intercross I believe that during the\nslow process of modification the individuals of the species will have been\nkept nearly uniform by intercrossing so that many individuals will have\ngone on simultaneously changing and the whole amount of modification will\nnot have been due at each stage to descent from a single parent To\nillustrate what I mean: our English racehorses differ slightly from the\nhorses of every other breed but they do not owe their difference and\nsuperiority to descent from any single pair but to continued care in\nselecting and training many individuals during many generations\n\nBefore discussing the three classes of facts which I have selected as\npresenting the greatest amount of difficulty on the theory of single\ncentres of creation I must say a few words on the means of dispersal\n\n\n\nMeans of DispersalSir C Lyell and other authors have ably treated\nthis subject I can give here only the briefest abstract of the more\nimportant facts Change of climate must have had a powerful influence on\nmigration: a region when its climate was different may have been a high\nroad for migration but now be impassable I shall however presently have\nto discuss this branch of the subject in some detail Changes of level in\nthe land must also have been highly influential: a narrow isthmus now\nseparates two marine faunas submerge it or let it formerly have been\nsubmerged and the two faunas will now blend or may formerly have blended:\nwhere the sea now extends land may at a former period have connected\nislands or 357 possibly even continents together and thus have allowed\nterrestrial productions to pass from one to the other No geologist will\ndispute that great mutations of level have occurred within the period of\nexisting organisms Edward Forbes insisted that all the islands in the\nAtlantic must recently have been connected with Europe or Africa and\nEurope likewise with America Other authors have thus hypothetically\nbridged over every ocean and have united almost every island to some\nmainland If indeed the arguments used by Forbes are to be trusted it must\nbe admitted that scarcely a single island exists which has not recently\nbeen united to some continent This view cuts the Gordian knot of the\ndispersal of the same species to the most distant points and removes many\na difficulty: but to the best of my judgment we are not authorized in\nadmitting such enormous geographical changes within the period of existing\nspecies It seems to me that we have abundant evidence of great\noscillations of level in our continents but not of such vast changes in\ntheir position and extension as to have united them within the recent\nperiod to each other and to the several intervening oceanic islands I\nfreely admit the former existence of many islands now buried beneath the\nsea which may have served as halting places for plants and for many\nanimals during their migration In the coralproducing oceans such sunken\nislands are now marked as I believe by rings of coral or atolls standing\nover them Whenever it is fully admitted as I believe it will some day be\nthat each species has proceeded from a single birthplace and when in the\ncourse of time we know something definite about the means of distribution\nwe shall be enabled to speculate with security on the former extension of\nthe land But I do not believe that it will ever be proved that within the\n358 recent period continents which are now quite separate have been\ncontinuously or almost continuously united with each other and with the\nmany existing oceanic islands Several facts in distributionsuch as the\ngreat difference in the marine faunas on the opposite sides of almost every\ncontinentthe close relation of the tertiary inhabitants of several lands\nand even seas to their present inhabitantsa certain degree of relation\nas we shall hereafter see between the distribution of mammals and the\ndepth of the seathese and other such facts seem to me opposed to the\nadmission of such prodigious geographical revolutions within the recent\nperiod as are necessitated on the view advanced by Forbes and admitted by\nhis many followers The nature and relative proportions of the inhabitants\nof oceanic islands likewise seem to me opposed to the belief of their\nformer continuity with continents Nor does their almost universally\nvolcanic composition favour the admission that they are the wrecks of\nsunken continentsif they had originally existed as mountainranges on\nthe land some at least of the islands would have been formed like other\nmountainsummits of granite metamorphic schists old fossiliferous or\nother such rocks instead of consisting of mere piles of volcanic matter\n\nI must now say a few words on what are called accidental means but which\nmore properly might be called occasional means of distribution I shall\nhere confine myself to plants In botanical works this or that plant is\nstated to be ill adapted for wide dissemination but for transport across\nthe sea the greater or less facilities may be said to be almost wholly\nunknown Until I tried with Mr Berkeleys aid a few experiments it was\nnot even known how far seeds could resist the injurious action of\nseawater To my surprise I found that 359 out of 87 kinds 64 germinated\nafter an immersion of 28 days and a few survived an immersion of 137 days\nFor convenience sake I chiefly tried small seeds without the capsule or\nfruit and as all of these sank in a few days they could not be floated\nacross wide spaces of the sea whether or not they were injured by the\nsaltwater Afterwards I tried some larger fruits capsules c and some\nof these floated for a long time It is well known what a difference there\nis in the buoyancy of green and seasoned timber and it occurred to me that\nfloods might wash down plants or branches and that these might be dried on\nthe banks and then by a fresh rise in the stream be washed into the sea\nHence I was led to dry stems and branches of 94 plants with ripe fruit and\nto place them on seawater The majority sank quickly but some which\nwhilst green floated for a very short time when dried floated much longer\nfor instance ripe hazelnuts sank immediately but when dried they floated\nfor 90 days and afterwards when planted they germinated an asparagus\nplant with ripe berries floated for 23 days when dried it floated for 85\ndays and the seeds afterwards germinated the ripe seeds of Helosciadium\nsank in two days when dried they floated for above 90 days and afterwards\ngerminated Altogether out of the 94 dried plants 18 floated for above 28\ndays and some of the 18 floated for a very much longer period So that as\n6487 seeds germinated after an immersion of 28 days and as 1894 plants\nwith ripe fruit but not all the same species as in the foregoing\nexperiment floated after being dried for above 28 days as far as we may\ninfer anything from these scanty facts we may conclude that the seeds of\n14100 plants of any country might be floated by seacurrents during 28\ndays and would retain their power of germination In Johnstons Physical\nAtlas the average 360 rate of the several Atlantic currents is 33 miles\nper diem some currents running at the rate of 60 miles per diem on this\naverage the seeds of 14100 plants belonging to one country might be\nfloated across 924 miles of sea to another country and when stranded if\nblown to a favourable spot by an inland gale they would germinate\n\nSubsequently to my experiments M Martens tried similar ones but in a\nmuch better manner for he placed the seeds in a box in the actual sea so\nthat they were alternately wet and exposed to the air like really floating\nplants He tried 98 seeds mostly different from mine but he chose many\nlarge fruits and likewise seeds from plants which live near the sea and\nthis would have favoured the average length of their flotation and of their\nresistance to the injurious action of the saltwater On the other hand he\ndid not previously dry the plants or branches with the fruit and this as\nwe have seen would have caused some of them to have floated much longer\nThe result was that 1898 of his seeds floated for 42 days and were then\ncapable of germination But I do not doubt that plants exposed to the waves\nwould float for a less time than those protected from violent movement as\nin our experiments Therefore it would perhaps be safer to assume that the\nseeds of about 10100 plants of a flora after having been dried could be\nfloated across a space of sea 900 miles in width and would then germinate\nThe fact of the larger fruits often floating longer than the small is\ninteresting as plants with large seeds or fruit could hardly be\ntransported by any other means and Alph de Candolle has shown that such\nplants generally have restricted ranges\n\nBut seeds may be occasionally transported in another manner Drift timber\nis thrown up on most islands 361 even on those in the midst of the\nwidest oceans and the natives of the coralislands in the Pacific procure\nstones for their tools solely from the roots of drifted trees these\nstones being a valuable royal tax I find on examination that when\nirregularly shaped stones are embedded in the roots of trees small parcels\nof earth are very frequently enclosed in their interstices and behind\nthemso perfectly that not a particle could be washed away in the longest\ntransport: out of one small portion of earth thus completely enclosed by\nwood in an oak about 50 years old three dicotyledonous plants germinated:\nI am certain of the accuracy of this observation Again I can show that\nthe carcasses of birds when floating on the sea sometimes escape being\nimmediately devoured and seeds of many kinds in the crops of floating\nbirds long retain their vitality: peas and vetches for instance are\nkilled by even a few days immersion in seawater but some taken out of\nthe crop of a pigeon which had floated on artificial saltwater for 30\ndays to my surprise nearly all germinated\n\nLiving birds can hardly fail to be highly effective agents in the\ntransportation of seeds I could give many facts showing how frequently\nbirds of many kinds are blown by gales to vast distances across the ocean\nWe may I think safely assume that under such circumstances their rate of\nflight would often be 35 miles an hour and some authors have given a far\nhigher estimate I have never seen an instance of nutritious seeds passing\nthrough the intestines of a bird but hard seeds of fruit pass uninjured\nthrough even the digestive organs of a turkey In the course of two months\nI picked up in my garden 12 kinds of seeds out of the excrement of small\nbirds and these seemed perfect and some of them which I tried\ngerminated 362 But the following fact is more important: the crops of\nbirds do not secrete gastric juice and do not in the least injure as I\nknow by trial the germination of seeds now after a bird has found and\ndevoured a large supply of food it is positively asserted that all the\ngrains do not pass into the gizzard for 12 or even 18 hours A bird in this\ninterval might easily be blown to the distance of 500 miles and hawks are\nknown to look out for tired birds and the contents of their torn crops\nmight thus readily get scattered Mr Brent informs me that a friend of his\nhad to give up flying carrierpigeons from France to England as the hawks\non the English coast destroyed so many on their arrival Some hawks and\nowls bolt their prey whole and after an interval of from twelve to twenty\nhours disgorge pellets which as I know from experiments made in the\nZoological Gardens include seeds capable of germination Some seeds of the\noat wheat millet canary hemp clover and beet germinated after having\nbeen from twelve to twentyone hours in the stomachs of different birds of\nprey and two seeds of beet grew after having been thus retained for two\ndays and fourteen hours Freshwater fish I find eat seeds of many land\nand water plants: fish are frequently devoured by birds and thus the seeds\nmight be transported from place to place I forced many kinds of seeds into\nthe stomachs of dead fish and then gave their bodies to fishingeagles\nstorks and pelicans these birds after an interval of many hours either\nrejected the seeds in pellets or passed them in their excrement and\nseveral of these seeds retained their power of germination Certain seeds\nhowever were always killed by this process\n\nAlthough the beaks and feet of birds are generally quite clean I can show\nthat earth sometimes adheres to them: in one instance I removed twentytwo\ngrains 363 of dry argillaceous earth from one foot of a partridge and in\nthis earth there was a pebble quite as large as the seed of a vetch Thus\nseeds might occasionally be transported to great distances for many facts\ncould be given showing that soil almost everywhere is charged with seeds\nReflect for a moment on the millions of quails which annually cross the\nMediterranean and can we doubt that the earth adhering to their feet would\nsometimes include a few minute seeds But I shall presently have to recur\nto this subject\n\nAs icebergs are known to be sometimes loaded with earth and stones and\nhave even carried brushwood bones and the nest of a landbird I can\nhardly doubt that they must occasionally have transported seeds from one\npart to another of the arctic and antarctic regions as suggested by Lyell\nand during the Glacial period from one part of the now temperate regions to\nanother In the Azores from the large number of the species of plants\ncommon to Europe in comparison with the plants of other oceanic islands\nnearer to the mainland and as remarked by Mr H C Watson from the\nsomewhat northern character of the flora in comparison with the latitude I\nsuspected that these islands had been partly stocked by iceborne seeds\nduring the Glacial epoch At my request Sir C Lyell wrote to M Hartung to\ninquire whether he had observed erratic boulders on these islands and he\nanswered that he had found large fragments of granite and other rocks\nwhich do not occur in the archipelago Hence we may safely infer that\nicebergs formerly landed their rocky burthens on the shores of these\nmidocean islands and it is at least possible that they may have brought\nthither the seeds of northern plants\n\nConsidering that the several above means of transport and that several\nother means which without 364 doubt remain to be discovered have been\nin action year after year for centuries and tens of thousands of years it\nwould I think be a marvellous fact if many plants had not thus become\nwidely transported These means of transport are sometimes called\naccidental but this is not strictly correct: the currents of the sea are\nnot accidental nor is the direction of prevalent gales of wind It should\nbe observed that scarcely any means of transport would carry seeds for very\ngreat distances for seeds do not retain their vitality when exposed for a\ngreat length of time to the action of seawater nor could they be long\ncarried in the crops or intestines of birds These means however would\nsuffice for occasional transport across tracts of sea some hundred miles in\nbreadth or from island to island or from a continent to a neighbouring\nisland but not from one distant continent to another The floras of\ndistant continents would not by such means become mingled in any great\ndegree but would remain as distinct as we now see them to be The\ncurrents from their course would never bring seeds from North America to\nBritain though they might and do bring seeds from the West Indies to our\nwestern shores where if not killed by so long an immersion in saltwater\nthey could not endure our climate Almost every year one or two landbirds\nare blown across the whole Atlantic Ocean from North America to the\nwestern shores of Ireland and England but seeds could be transported by\nthese wanderers only by one means namely in dirt sticking to their feet\nwhich is in itself a rare accident Even in this case how small would the\nchance be of a seed falling on favourable soil and coming to maturity But\nit would be a great error to argue that because a wellstocked island like\nGreat Britain has not as far as is known 365 and it would be very\ndifficult to prove this received within the last few centuries through\noccasional means of transport immigrants from Europe or any other\ncontinent that a poorlystocked island though standing more remote from\nthe mainland would not receive colonists by similar means I do not doubt\nthat out of twenty seeds or animals transported to an island even if far\nless wellstocked than Britain scarcely more than one would be so well\nfitted to its new home as to become naturalised But this as it seems to\nme is no valid argument against what would be effected by occasional means\nof transport during the long lapse of geological time whilst an island\nwas being upheaved and formed and before it had become fully stocked with\ninhabitants On almost bare land with few or no destructive insects or\nbirds living there nearly every seed which chanced to arrive if fitted\nfor the climate would be sure to germinate and survive\n\n\n\nDispersal during the Glacial periodThe identity of many plants and\nanimals on mountainsummits separated from each other by hundreds of\nmiles of lowlands where the Alpine species could not possibly exist is\none of the most striking cases known of the same species living at distant\npoints without the apparent possibility of their having migrated from one\nto the other It is indeed a remarkable fact to see so many of the same\nplants living on the snowy regions of the Alps or Pyrenees and in the\nextreme northern parts of Europe but it is far more remarkable that the\nplants on the White Mountains in the United States of America are all the\nsame with those of Labrador and nearly all the same as we hear from Asa\nGray with those on the loftiest mountains of Europe Even as long ago as\n1747 such facts led Gmelin to conclude that the 366 same species must\nhave been independently created at several distinct points and we might\nhave remained in this same belief had not Agassiz and others called vivid\nattention to the Glacial period which as we shall immediately see\naffords a simple explanation of these facts We have evidence of almost\nevery conceivable kind organic and inorganic that within a very recent\ngeological period central Europe and North America suffered under an\nArctic climate The ruins of a house burnt by fire do not tell their tale\nmore plainly than do the mountains of Scotland and Wales with their\nscored flanks polished surfaces and perched boulders of the icy streams\nwith which their valleys were lately filled So greatly has the climate of\nEurope changed that in Northern Italy gigantic moraines left by old\nglaciers are now clothed by the vine and maize Throughout a large part of\nthe United States erratic boulders and rocks scored by drifted icebergs\nand coastice plainly reveal a former cold period\n\nThe former influence of the glacial climate on the distribution of the\ninhabitants of Europe as explained with remarkable clearness by Edward\nForbes is substantially as follows But we shall follow the changes more\nreadily by supposing a new glacial period to come slowly on and then pass\naway as formerly occurred As the cold came on and as each more southern\nzone became fitted for arctic beings and illfitted for their former more\ntemperate inhabitants the latter would be supplanted and arctic\nproductions would take their places The inhabitants of the more temperate\nregions would at the same time travel southward unless they were stopped\nby barriers in which case they would perish The mountains would become\ncovered with snow and ice and their former Alpine inhabitants would\ndescend to the plains By the time that the cold had reached 367 its\nmaximum we should have a uniform arctic fauna and flora covering the\ncentral parts of Europe as far south as the Alps and Pyrenees and even\nstretching into Spain The now temperate regions of the United States would\nlikewise be covered by arctic plants and animals and these would be nearly\nthe same with those of Europe for the present circumpolar inhabitants\nwhich we suppose to have everywhere travelled southward are remarkably\nuniform round the world We may suppose that the Glacial period came on a\nlittle earlier or later in North America than in Europe so will the\nsouthern migration there have been a little earlier or later but this will\nmake no difference in the final result\n\nAs the warmth returned the arctic forms would retreat northward closely\nfollowed up in their retreat by the productions of the more temperate\nregions And as the snow melted from the bases of the mountains the arctic\nforms would seize on the cleared and thawed ground always ascending higher\nand higher as the warmth increased whilst their brethren were pursuing\ntheir northern journey Hence when the warmth had fully returned the same\narctic species which had lately lived in a body together on the lowlands\nof the Old and New Worlds would be left isolated on distant\nmountainsummits having been exterminated on all lesser heights and in\nthe arctic regions of both hemispheres\n\nThus we can understand the identity of many plants at points so immensely\nremote as on the mountains of the United States and of Europe We can thus\nalso understand the fact that the Alpine plants of each mountainrange are\nmore especially related to the arctic forms living due north or nearly due\nnorth of them: for the migration as the cold came on and the remigration\non the returning warmth will generally 368 have been due south and\nnorth The Alpine plants for example of Scotland as remarked by Mr\nH C Watson and those of the Pyrenees as remarked by Ramond are more\nespecially allied to the plants of northern Scandinavia those of the\nUnited States to Labrador those of the mountains of Siberia to the arctic\nregions of that country These views grounded as they are on the perfectly\nwellascertained occurrence of a former Glacial period seem to me to\nexplain in so satisfactory a manner the present distribution of the Alpine\nand Arctic productions of Europe and America that when in other regions we\nfind the same species on distant mountainsummits we may almost conclude\nwithout other evidence that a colder climate permitted their former\nmigration across the low intervening tracts since become too warm for\ntheir existence\n\nIf the climate since the Glacial period has ever been in any degree\nwarmer than at present as some geologists in the United States believe to\nhave been the case chiefly from the distribution of the fossil Gnathodon\nthen the arctic and temperate productions will at a very late period have\nmarched a little further north and subsequently have retreated to their\npresent homes but I have met with no satisfactory evidence with respect to\nthis intercalated slightly warmer period since the Glacial period\n\nThe arctic forms during their long southern migration and remigration\nnorthward will have been exposed to nearly the same climate and as is\nespecially to be noticed they will have kept in a body together\nconsequently their mutual relations will not have been much disturbed and\nin accordance with the principles inculcated in this volume they will not\nhave been liable to much modification But with our Alpine productions\nleft isolated from the moment of the returning warmth 369 first at the\nbases and ultimately on the summits of the mountains the case will have\nbeen somewhat different for it is not likely that all the same arctic\nspecies will have been left on mountain ranges distant from each other and\nhave survived there ever since they will also in all probability have\nbecome mingled with ancient Alpine species which must have existed on the\nmountains before the commencement of the Glacial epoch and which during\nits coldest period will have been temporarily driven down to the plains\nthey will also have been exposed to somewhat different climatal\ninfluences Their mutual relations will thus have been in some degree\ndisturbed consequently they will have been liable to modification and\nthis we find has been the case for if we compare the present Alpine plants\nand animals of the several great European mountainranges though very many\nof the species are identically the same some present varieties some are\nranked as doubtful forms and some few are distinct yet closely allied or\nrepresentative species\n\nIn illustrating what as I believe actually took place during the Glacial\nperiod I assumed that at its commencement the arctic productions were as\nuniform round the polar regions as they are at the present day But the\nforegoing remarks on distribution apply not only to strictly arctic forms\nbut also to many subarctic and to some few northern temperate forms for\nsome of these are the same on the lower mountains and on the plains of\nNorth America and Europe and it may be reasonably asked how I account for\nthe necessary degree of uniformity of the subarctic and northern temperate\nforms round the world at the commencement of the Glacial period At the\npresent day the subarctic and northern temperate productions of the Old\nand New Worlds are separated from each other by the 370 Atlantic Ocean\nand by the extreme northern part of the Pacific During the Glacial period\nwhen the inhabitants of the Old and New Worlds lived further southwards\nthan at present they must have been still more completely separated by\nwider spaces of ocean I believe the above difficulty may be surmounted by\nlooking to still earlier changes of climate of an opposite nature We have\ngood reason to believe that during the newer Pliocene period before the\nGlacial epoch and whilst the majority of the inhabitants of the world were\nspecifically the same as now the climate was warmer than at the present\nday Hence we may suppose that the organisms now living under the climate\nof latitude 60 during the Pliocene period lived further north under the\nPolar Circle in latitude 6667 and that the strictly arctic productions\nthen lived on the broken land still nearer to the pole Now if we look at a\nglobe we shall see that under the Polar Circle there is almost continuous\nland from western Europe through Siberia to eastern America And to this\ncontinuity of the circumpolar land and to the consequent freedom for\nintermigration under a more favourable climate I attribute the necessary\namount of uniformity in the subarctic and northern temperate productions\nof the Old and New Worlds at a period anterior to the Glacial epoch\n\nBelieving from reasons before alluded to that our continents have long\nremained in nearly the same relative position though subjected to large\nbut partial oscillations of level I am strongly inclined to extend the\nabove view and to infer that during some earlier and still warmer period\nsuch as the older Pliocene period a large number of the same plants and\nanimals inhabited the almost continuous circumpolar land and that these\nplants and animals both in the Old and 371 New Worlds began slowly to\nmigrate southwards as the climate became less warm long before the\ncommencement of the Glacial period We now see as I believe their\ndescendants mostly in a modified condition in the central parts of Europe\nand the United States On this view we can understand the relationship\nwith very little identity between the productions of North America and\nEuropea relationship which is most remarkable considering the distance\nof the two areas and their separation by the Atlantic Ocean We can\nfurther understand the singular fact remarked on by several observers that\nthe productions of Europe and America during the later tertiary stages were\nmore closely related to each other than they are at the present time for\nduring these warmer periods the northern parts of the Old and New Worlds\nwill have been almost continuously united by land serving as a bridge\nsince rendered impassable by cold for the intermigration of their\ninhabitants\n\nDuring the slowly decreasing warmth of the Pliocene period as soon as the\nspecies in common which inhabited the New and Old Worlds migrated south\nof the Polar Circle they must have been completely cut off from each\nother This separation as far as the more temperate productions are\nconcerned took place long ages ago And as the plants and animals migrated\nsouthward they will have become mingled in the one great region with the\nnative American productions and have had to compete with them and in the\nother great region with those of the Old World Consequently we have here\neverything favourable for much modificationfor far more modification\nthan with the Alpine productions left isolated within a much more recent\nperiod on the several mountainranges and on the arctic lands of the two\nWorlds Hence it has come that when we compare 372 the now living\nproductions of the temperate regions of the New and Old Worlds we find\nvery few identical species though Asa Gray has lately shown that more\nplants are identical than was formerly supposed but we find in every\ngreat class many forms which some naturalists rank as geographical races\nand others as distinct species and a host of closely allied or\nrepresentative forms which are ranked by all naturalists as specifically\ndistinct\n\nAs on the land so in the waters of the sea a slow southern migration of a\nmarine fauna which during the Pliocene or even a somewhat earlier period\nwas nearly uniform along the continuous shores of the Polar Circle will\naccount on the theory of modification for many closely allied forms now\nliving in areas completely sundered Thus I think we can understand the\npresence of many existing and tertiary representative forms on the eastern\nand western shores of temperate North America and the still more striking\ncase of many closely allied crustaceans as described in Danas admirable\nwork of some fish and other marine animals in the Mediterranean and in\nthe seas of Japanareas now separated by a continent and by nearly a\nhemisphere of equatorial ocean\n\nThese cases of relationship without identity of the inhabitants of seas\nnow disjoined and likewise of the past and present inhabitants of the\ntemperate lands of North America and Europe are inexplicable on the theory\nof creation We cannot say that they have been created alike in\ncorrespondence with the nearly similar physical conditions of the areas\nfor if we compare for instance certain parts of South America with the\nsouthern continents of the Old World we see countries closely\ncorresponding in all their physical conditions but with their inhabitants\nutterly dissimilar 373\n\nBut we must return to our more immediate subject the Glacial period I am\nconvinced that Forbess view may be largely extended In Europe we have the\nplainest evidence of the cold period from the western shores of Britain to\nthe Oural range and southward to the Pyrenees We may infer from the\nfrozen mammals and nature of the mountain vegetation that Siberia was\nsimilarly affected Along the Himalaya at points 900 miles apart glaciers\nhave left the marks of their former low descent and in Sikkim Dr Hooker\nsaw maize growing on gigantic ancient moraines South of the equator we\nhave some direct evidence of former glacial action in New Zealand and the\nsame plants found on widely separated mountains in that island tell the\nsame story If one account which has been published can be trusted we have\ndirect evidence of glacial action in the southeastern corner of Australia\n\nLooking to America in the northern half iceborne fragments of rock have\nbeen observed on the eastern side as far south as lat 3637 and on the\nshores of the Pacific where the climate is now so different as far south\nas lat 46 erratic boulders have also been noticed on the Rocky\nMountains In the Cordillera of Equatorial South America glaciers once\nextended far below their present level In central Chili I was astonished\nat the structure of a vast mound of detritus about 800 feet in height\ncrossing a valley of the Andes and this I now feel convinced was a\ngigantic moraine left far below any existing glacier Further south on\nboth sides of the continent from lat 41 to the southernmost extremity\nwe have the clearest evidence of former glacial action in huge boulders\ntransported far from their parent source\n\nWe do not know that the Glacial epoch was strictly simultaneous at these\nseveral far distant points on 374 opposite sides of the world But we\nhave good evidence in almost every case that the epoch was included within\nthe latest geological period We have also excellent evidence that it\nendured for an enormous time as measured by years at each point The cold\nmay have come on or have ceased earlier at one point of the globe than at\nanother but seeing that it endured for long at each and that it was\ncontemporaneous in a geological sense it seems to me probable that it was\nduring a part at least of the period actually simultaneous throughout the\nworld Without some distinct evidence to the contrary we may at least\nadmit as probable that the glacial action was simultaneous on the eastern\nand western sides of North America in the Cordillera under the equator and\nunder the warmer temperate zones and on both sides of the southern\nextremity of the continent If this be admitted it is difficult to avoid\nbelieving that the temperature of the whole world was at this period\nsimultaneously cooler But it would suffice for my purpose if the\ntemperature was at the same time lower along certain broad belts of\nlongitude\n\nOn this view of the whole world or at least of broad longitudinal belts\nhaving been simultaneously colder from pole to pole much light can be\nthrown on the present distribution of identical and allied species In\nAmerica Dr Hooker has shown that between forty and fifty of the flowering\nplants of Tierra del Fuego forming no inconsiderable part of its scanty\nflora are common to Europe enormously remote as these two points are and\nthere are many closely allied species On the lofty mountains of equatorial\nAmerica a host of peculiar species belonging to European genera occur On\nthe highest mountains of Brazil some few European genera were found by\nGardner which do not exist in the wide 375 intervening hot countries So\non the Silla of Caraccas the illustrious Humboldt long ago found species\nbelonging to genera characteristic of the Cordillera On the mountains of\nAbyssinia several European forms and some few representatives of the\npeculiar flora of the Cape of Good Hope occur At the Cape of Good Hope a\nvery few European species believed not to have been introduced by man and\non the mountains some few representative European forms are found which\nhave not been discovered in the intertropical parts of Africa On the\nHimalaya and on the isolated mountainranges of the peninsula of India on\nthe heights of Ceylon and on the volcanic cones of Java many plants\noccur either identically the same or representing each other and at the\nsame time representing plants of Europe not found in the intervening hot\nlowlands A list of the genera collected on the loftier peaks of Java\nraises a picture of a collection made on a hill in Europe Still more\nstriking is the fact that southern Australian forms are clearly represented\nby plants growing on the summits of the mountains of Borneo Some of these\nAustralian forms as I hear from Dr Hooker extend along the heights of\nthe peninsula of Malacca and are thinly scattered on the one hand over\nIndia and on the other as far north as Japan\n\nOn the southern mountains of Australia Dr F Mller has discovered\nseveral European species other species not introduced by man occur on\nthe lowlands and a long list can be given as I am informed by Dr Hooker\nof European genera found in Australia but not in the intermediate torrid\nregions In the admirable Introduction to the Flora of New Zealand by\nDr Hooker analogous and striking facts are given in regard to the plants\nof that large island Hence we see that throughout the world the plants\ngrowing on the 376 more lofty mountains and on the temperate lowlands of\nthe northern and southern hemispheres are sometimes identically the same\nbut they are much oftener specifically distinct though related to each\nother in a most remarkable manner\n\nThis brief abstract applies to plants alone: some strictly analogous facts\ncould be given on the distribution of terrestrial animals In marine\nproductions similar cases occur as an example I may quote a remark by\nthe highest authority Prof Dana that it is certainly a wonderful fact\nthat New Zealand should have a closer resemblance in its Crustacea to Great\nBritain its antipode than to any other part of the world Sir J\nRichardson also speaks of the reappearance on the shores of New Zealand\nTasmania c of northern forms of fish Dr Hooker informs me that\ntwentyfive species of Alg are common to New Zealand and to Europe but\nhave not been found in the intermediate tropical seas\n\nIt should be observed that the northern species and forms found in the\nsouthern parts of the southern hemisphere and on the mountainranges of\nthe intertropical regions are not arctic but belong to the northern\ntemperate zones As Mr H C Watson has recently remarked In receding\nfrom polar towards equatorial latitudes the Alpine or mountain floras\nreally become less and less arctic Many of the forms living on the\nmountains of the warmer regions of the earth and in the southern hemisphere\nare of doubtful value being ranked by some naturalists as specifically\ndistinct by others as varieties but some are certainly identical and\nmany though closely related to northern forms must be ranked as distinct\nspecies\n\nNow let us see what light can be thrown on the foregoing facts on the\nbelief supported as it is by a large 377 body of geological evidence\nthat the whole world or a large part of it was during the Glacial period\nsimultaneously much colder than at present The Glacial period as measured\nby years must have been very long and when we remember over what vast\nspaces some naturalised plants and animals have spread within a few\ncenturies this period will have been ample for any amount of migration As\nthe cold came slowly on all the tropical plants and other productions will\nhave retreated from both sides towards the equator followed in the rear by\nthe temperate productions and these by the arctic but with the latter we\nare not now concerned The tropical plants probably suffered much\nextinction how much no one can say perhaps formerly the tropics supported\nas many species as we see at the present day crowded together at the Cape\nof Good Hope and in parts of temperate Australia As we know that many\ntropical plants and animals can withstand a considerable amount of cold\nmany might have escaped extermination during a moderate fall of\ntemperature more especially by escaping into the lowest most protected\nand warmest districts But the great fact to bear in mind is that all\ntropical productions will have suffered to a certain extent On the other\nhand the temperate productions after migrating nearer to the equator\nthough they will have been placed under somewhat new conditions will have\nsuffered less And it is certain that many temperate plants if protected\nfrom the inroads of competitors can withstand a much warmer climate than\ntheir own Hence it seems to me possible bearing in mind that the\ntropical productions were in a suffering state and could not have presented\na firm front against intruders that a certain number of the more vigorous\nand dominant temperate forms might have penetrated the native ranks and\nhave reached or 378 even crossed the equator The invasion would of\ncourse have been greatly favoured by high land and perhaps by a dry\nclimate for Dr Falconer informs me that it is the damp with the heat of\nthe tropics which is so destructive to perennial plants from a temperate\nclimate On the other hand the most humid and hottest districts will have\nafforded an asylum to the tropical natives The mountainranges northwest\nof the Himalaya and the long line of the Cordillera seem to have afforded\ntwo great lines of invasion: and it is a striking fact lately communicated\nto me by Dr Hooker that all the flowering plants about fortysix in\nnumber common to Tierra del Fuego and to Europe still exist in North\nAmerica which must have lain on the line of march But I do not doubt that\nsome temperate productions entered and crossed even the lowlands of the\ntropics at the period when the cold was most intensewhen arctic forms\nhad migrated some twentyfive degrees of latitude from their native country\nand covered the land at the foot of the Pyrenees At this period of extreme\ncold I believe that the climate under the equator at the level of the sea\nwas about the same with that now felt there at the height of six or seven\nthousand feet During this the coldest period I suppose that large spaces\nof the tropical lowlands were clothed with a mingled tropical and temperate\nvegetation like that now growing with strange luxuriance at the base of\nthe Himalaya as graphically described by Hooker\n\nThus as I believe a considerable number of plants a few terrestrial\nanimals and some marine productions migrated during the Glacial period\nfrom the northern and southern temperate zones into the intertropical\nregions and some even crossed the equator As the warmth returned these\ntemperate forms would naturally ascend the higher mountains being\nexterminated on the 379 lowlands those which had not reached the equator\nwould remigrate northward or southward towards their former homes but the\nforms chiefly northern which had crossed the equator would travel still\nfurther from their homes into the more temperate latitudes of the opposite\nhemisphere Although we have reason to believe from geological evidence\nthat the whole body of arctic shells underwent scarcely any modification\nduring their long southern migration and remigration northward the case\nmay have been wholly different with those intruding forms which settled\nthemselves on the intertropical mountains and in the southern hemisphere\nThese being surrounded by strangers will have had to compete with many new\nforms of life and it is probable that selected modifications in their\nstructure habits and constitutions will have profited them Thus many of\nthese wanderers though still plainly related by inheritance to their\nbrethren of the northern or southern hemispheres now exist in their new\nhomes as wellmarked varieties or as distinct species\n\nIt is a remarkable fact strongly insisted on by Hooker in regard to\nAmerica and by Alph de Candolle in regard to Australia that many more\nidentical plants and allied forms have apparently migrated from the north\nto the south than in a reversed direction We see however a few southern\nvegetable forms on the mountains of Borneo and Abyssinia I suspect that\nthis preponderant migration from north to south is due to the greater\nextent of land in the north and to the northern forms having existed in\ntheir own homes in greater numbers and having consequently been advanced\nthrough natural selection and competition to a higher stage of perfection\nor dominating power than the southern forms And thus when they became\ncommingled during the Glacial period the northern forms 380 were enabled\nto beat the less powerful southern forms Just in the same manner as we see\nat the present day that very many European productions cover the ground in\nLa Plata and in a lesser degree in Australia and have to a certain extent\nbeaten the natives whereas extremely few southern forms have become\nnaturalised in any part of Europe though hides wool and other objects\nlikely to carry seeds have been largely imported into Europe during the\nlast two or three centuries from La Plata and during the last thirty or\nforty years from Australia Something of the same kind must have occurred\non the intertropical mountains: no doubt before the Glacial period they\nwere stocked with endemic Alpine forms but these have almost everywhere\nlargely yielded to the more dominant forms generated in the larger areas\nand more efficient workshops of the north In many islands the native\nproductions are nearly equalled or even outnumbered by the naturalised and\nif the natives have not been actually exterminated their numbers have been\ngreatly reduced and this is the first stage towards extinction A mountain\nis an island on the land and the intertropical mountains before the\nGlacial period must have been completely isolated and I believe that the\nproductions of these islands on the land yielded to those produced within\nthe larger areas of the north just in the same way as the productions of\nreal islands have everywhere lately yielded to continental forms\nnaturalised by mans agency\n\nI am far from supposing that all difficulties are removed on the view here\ngiven in regard to the range and affinities of the allied species which\nlive in the northern and southern temperate zones and on the mountains of\nthe intertropical regions Very many difficulties remain to be solved I do\nnot pretend to 381 indicate the exact lines and means of migration or\nthe reason why certain species and not others have migrated why certain\nspecies have been modified and have given rise to new groups of forms and\nothers have remained unaltered We cannot hope to explain such facts until\nwe can say why one species and not another becomes naturalised by mans\nagency in a foreign land why one ranges twice or thrice as far and is\ntwice or thrice as common as another species within their own homes\n\nI have said that many difficulties remain to be solved: some of the most\nremarkable are stated with admirable clearness by Dr Hooker in his\nbotanical works on the antarctic regions These cannot be here discussed I\nwill only say that as far as regards the occurrence of identical species at\npoints so enormously remote as Kerguelen Land New Zealand and Fuegia I\nbelieve that towards the close of the Glacial period icebergs as\nsuggested by Lyell have been largely concerned in their dispersal But the\nexistence of several quite distinct species belonging to genera\nexclusively confined to the south at these and other distant points of the\nsouthern hemisphere is on my theory of descent with modification a far\nmore remarkable case of difficulty For some of these species are so\ndistinct that we cannot suppose that there has been time since the\ncommencement of the Glacial period for their migration and for their\nsubsequent modification to the necessary degree The facts seem to me to\nindicate that peculiar and very distinct species have migrated in radiating\nlines from some common centre and I am inclined to look in the southern\nas in the northern hemisphere to a former and warmer period before the\ncommencement of the Glacial period when the antarctic lands now covered\nwith ice supported a highly peculiar 382 and isolated flora I suspect\nthat before this flora was exterminated by the Glacial epoch a few forms\nwere widely dispersed to various points of the southern hemisphere by\noccasional means of transport and by the aid as haltingplaces of\nexisting and now sunken islands: By these means as I believe the southern\nshores of America Australia New Zealand have become slightly tinted by\nthe same peculiar forms of vegetable life\n\nSir C Lyell in a striking passage has speculated in language almost\nidentical with mine on the effects of great alternations of climate on\ngeographical distribution I believe that the world has recently felt one\nof his great cycles of change and that on this view combined with\nmodification through natural selection a multitude of facts in the present\ndistribution both of the same and of allied forms of life can be explained\nThe living waters may be said to have flowed during one short period from\nthe north and from the south and to have crossed at the equator but to\nhave flowed with greater force from the north so as to have freely\ninundated the south As the tide leaves its drift in horizontal lines\nthough rising higher on the shores where the tide rises highest so have\nthe living waters left their living drift on our mountainsummits in a\nline gently rising from the arctic lowlands to a great height under the\nequator The various beings thus left stranded may be compared with savage\nraces of man driven up and surviving in the mountainfastnesses of almost\nevery land which serve as a record full of interest to us of the former\ninhabitants of the surrounding lowlands\n\n                                   \n\n\n383\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nGEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTIONcontinued\n\n    Distribution of freshwater productionsOn the inhabitants of oceanic\n    islandsAbsence of Batrachians and of terrestrial MammalsOn the\n    relation of the inhabitants of islands to those of the nearest\n    mainlandOn colonisation from the nearest source with subsequent\n    modificationSummary of the last and present chapters\n\nAs lakes and riversystems are separated from each other by barriers of\nland it might have been thought that freshwater productions would not\nhave ranged widely within the same country and as the sea is apparently a\nstill more impassable barrier that they never would have extended to\ndistant countries But the case is exactly the reverse Not only have many\nfreshwater species belonging to quite different classes an enormous\nrange but allied species prevail in a remarkable manner throughout the\nworld I well remember when first collecting in the fresh waters of\nBrazil feeling much surprise at the similarity of the freshwater insects\nshells c and at the dissimilarity of the surrounding terrestrial\nbeings compared with those of Britain\n\nBut this power in freshwater productions of ranging widely though so\nunexpected can I think in most cases be explained by their having become\nfitted in a manner highly useful to them for short and frequent\nmigrations from pond to pond or from stream to stream and liability to\nwide dispersal would follow from this capacity as an almost necessary\nconsequence We can here consider only a few cases In regard to 384\nfish I believe that the same species never occur in the fresh waters of\ndistant continents But on the same continent the species often range\nwidely and almost capriciously for two riversystems will have some fish\nin common and some different A few facts seem to favour the possibility of\ntheir occasional transport by accidental means like that of the live fish\nnot rarely dropped by whirlwinds in India and the vitality of their ova\nwhen removed from the water But I am inclined to attribute the dispersal\nof freshwater fish mainly to slight changes within the recent period in\nthe level of the land having caused rivers to flow into each other\nInstances also could be given of this having occurred during floods\nwithout any change of level We have evidence in the loess of the Rhine of\nconsiderable changes of level in the land within a very recent geological\nperiod and when the surface was peopled by existing land and freshwater\nshells The wide difference of the fish on opposite sides of continuous\nmountainranges which from an early period must have parted riversystems\nand completely prevented their inosculation seems to lead to this same\nconclusion With respect to allied freshwater fish occurring at very\ndistant points of the world no doubt there are many cases which cannot at\npresent be explained: but some freshwater fish belong to very ancient\nforms and in such cases there will have been ample time for great\ngeographical changes and consequently time and means for much migration\nIn the second place saltwater fish can with care be slowly accustomed to\nlive in fresh water and according to Valenciennes there is hardly a\nsingle group of fishes confined exclusively to fresh water so that we may\nimagine that a marine member of a freshwater group might travel far along\nthe shores of the sea and 385 subsequently become modified and adapted\nto the fresh waters of a distant land\n\nSome species of freshwater shells have a very wide range and allied\nspecies which on my theory are descended from a common parent and must\nhave proceeded from a single source prevail throughout the world Their\ndistribution at first perplexed me much as their ova are not likely to be\ntransported by birds and they are immediately killed by seawater as are\nthe adults I could not even understand how some naturalised species have\nrapidly spread throughout the same country But two facts which I have\nobservedand no doubt many others remain to be observedthrow some light\non this subject When a duck suddenly emerges from a pond covered with\nduckweed I have twice seen these little plants adhering to its back and\nit has happened to me in removing a little duckweed from one aquarium to\nanother that I have quite unintentionally stocked the one with freshwater\nshells from the other But another agency is perhaps more effectual: I\nsuspended a ducks feet which might represent those of a bird sleeping in\na natural pond in an aquarium where many ova of freshwater shells were\nhatching and I found that numbers of the extremely minute and justhatched\nshells crawled on the feet and clung to them so firmly that when taken out\nof the water they could not be jarred off though at a somewhat more\nadvanced age they would voluntarily drop off These just hatched molluscs\nthough aquatic in their nature survived on the ducks feet in damp air\nfrom twelve to twenty hours and in this length of time a duck or heron\nmight fly at least six or seven hundred miles and would be sure to alight\non a pool or rivulet if blown across sea to an oceanic island or to any\nother distant point Sir Charles Lyell also 386 informs me that a Dyticus\nhas been caught with an Ancylus a freshwater shell like a limpet firmly\nadhering to it and a waterbeetle of the same family a Colymbetes once\nflew on board the Beagle when fortyfive miles distant from the nearest\nland: how much farther it might have flown with a favouring gale no one can\ntell\n\nWith respect to plants it has long been known what enormous ranges many\nfreshwater and even marshspecies have both over continents and to the\nmost remote oceanic islands This is strikingly shown as remarked by Alph\nde Candolle in large groups of terrestrial plants which have only a very\nfew aquatic members for these latter seem immediately to acquire as if in\nconsequence a very wide range I think favourable means of dispersal\nexplain this fact I have before mentioned that earth occasionally though\nrarely adheres in some quantity to the feet and beaks of birds Wading\nbirds which frequent the muddy edges of ponds if suddenly flushed would\nbe the most likely to have muddy feet Birds of this order I can show are\nthe greatest wanderers and are occasionally found on the most remote and\nbarren islands in the open ocean they would not be likely to alight on the\nsurface of the sea so that the dirt would not be washed off their feet\nwhen making land they would be sure to fly to their natural freshwater\nhaunts I do not believe that botanists are aware how charged the mud of\nponds is with seeds: I have tried several little experiments but will here\ngive only the most striking case: I took in February three tablespoonfuls\nof mud from three different points beneath water on the edge of a little\npond this mud when dry weighed only 6 ounces I kept it covered up in my\nstudy for six months pulling up and counting each plant as it grew the\nplants were 387 of many kinds and were altogether 537 in number and yet\nthe viscid mud was all contained in a breakfast cup Considering these\nfacts I think it would be an inexplicable circumstance if waterbirds did\nnot transport the seeds of freshwater plants to vast distances and if\nconsequently the range of these plants was not very great The same agency\nmay have come into play with the eggs of some of the smaller freshwater\nanimals\n\nOther and unknown agencies probably have also played a part I have stated\nthat freshwater fish eat some kinds of seeds though they reject many\nother kinds after having swallowed them even small fish swallow seeds of\nmoderate size as of the yellow waterlily and Potamogeton Herons and\nother birds century after century have gone on daily devouring fish they\nthen take flight and go to other waters or are blown across the sea and\nwe have seen that seeds retain their power of germination when rejected in\npellets or in excrement many hours afterwards When I saw the great size\nof the seeds of that fine waterlily the Nelumbium and remembered Alph\nde Candolles remarks on this plant I thought that its distribution must\nremain quite inexplicable but Audubon states that he found the seeds of\nthe great southern waterlily probably according to Dr Hooker the\nNelumbium luteum in a herons stomach although I do not know the fact\nyet analogy makes me believe that a heron flying to another pond and\ngetting a hearty meal of fish would probably reject from its stomach a\npellet containing the seeds of the Nelumbium undigested or the seeds might\nbe dropped by the bird whilst feeding its young in the same way as fish\nare known sometimes to be dropped\n\nIn considering these several means of distribution 388 it should be\nremembered that when a pond or stream is first formed for instance on a\nrising islet it will be unoccupied and a single seed or egg will have a\ngood chance of succeeding Although there will always be a struggle for\nlife between the individuals of the species however few already occupying\nany pond yet as the number of kinds is small compared with those on the\nland the competition will probably be less severe between aquatic than\nbetween terrestrial species consequently an intruder from the waters of a\nforeign country would have a better chance of seizing on a place than in\nthe case of terrestrial colonists We should also remember that some\nperhaps many freshwater productions are low in the scale of nature and\nthat we have reason to believe that such low beings change or become\nmodified less quickly than the high and this will give longer time than\nthe average for the migration of the same aquatic species We should not\nforget the probability of many species having formerly ranged as\ncontinuously as freshwater productions ever can range over immense areas\nand having subsequently become extinct in intermediate regions But the\nwide distribution of freshwater plants and of the lower animals whether\nretaining the same identical form or in some degree modified I believe\nmainly depends on the wide dispersal of their seeds and eggs by animals\nmore especially by freshwater birds which have large powers of flight\nand naturally travel from one to another and often distant piece of water\nNature like a careful gardener thus takes her seeds from a bed of a\nparticular nature and drops them in another equally well fitted for them\n\n\n\nOn the Inhabitants of Oceanic IslandsWe now come to the last of the\nthree classes of facts which I 389 have selected as presenting the\ngreatest amount of difficulty on the view that all the individuals both of\nthe same and of allied species have descended from a single parent and\ntherefore have all proceeded from a common birthplace notwithstanding that\nin the course of time they have come to inhabit distant points of the\nglobe I have already stated that I cannot honestly admit Forbess view on\ncontinental extensions which if legitimately followed out would lead to\nthe belief that within the recent period all existing islands have been\nnearly or quite joined to some continent This view would remove many\ndifficulties but it would not I think explain all the facts in regard to\ninsular productions In the following remarks I shall not confine myself to\nthe mere question of dispersal but shall consider some other facts which\nbear on the truth of the two theories of independent creation and of\ndescent with modification\n\nThe species of all kinds which inhabit oceanic islands are few in number\ncompared with those on equal continental areas: Alph de Candolle admits\nthis for plants and Wollaston for insects If we look to the large size\nand varied stations of New Zealand extending over 780 miles of latitude\nand compare its flowering plants only 750 in number with those on an\nequal area at the Cape of Good Hope or in Australia we must I think\nadmit that something quite independently of any difference in physical\nconditions has caused so great a difference in number Even the uniform\ncounty of Cambridge has 847 plants and the little island of Anglesea 764\nbut a few ferns and a few introduced plants are included in these numbers\nand the comparison in some other respects is not quite fair We have\nevidence that the barren island of Ascension aboriginally possessed under\nhalfadozen flowering plants 390 yet many have become naturalised on\nit as they have on New Zealand and on every other oceanic island which can\nbe named In St Helena there is reason to believe that the naturalised\nplants and animals have nearly or quite exterminated many native\nproductions He who admits the doctrine of the creation of each separate\nspecies will have to admit that a sufficient number of the best adapted\nplants and animals have not been created on oceanic islands for man has\nunintentionally stocked them from various sources far more fully and\nperfectly than has nature\n\nAlthough in oceanic islands the number of kinds of inhabitants is scanty\nthe proportion of endemic species ie those found nowhere else in the\nworld is often extremely large If we compare for instance the number of\nthe endemic landshells in Madeira or of the endemic birds in the\nGalapagos Archipelago with the number found on any continent and then\ncompare the area of the islands with that of the continent we shall see\nthat this is true This fact might have been expected on my theory for as\nalready explained species occasionally arriving after long intervals in a\nnew and isolated district and having to compete with new associates will\nbe eminently liable to modification and will often produce groups of\nmodified descendants But it by no means follows that because in an\nisland nearly all the species of one class are peculiar those of another\nclass or of another section of the same class are peculiar and this\ndifference seems to depend partly on the species which do not become\nmodified having immigrated with facility and in a body so that their\nmutual relations have not been much disturbed and partly on the frequent\narrival of unmodified immigrants from the mothercountry and the\nconsequent intercrossing with them With respect to the effects of this\nintercrossing 391 it should be remembered that the offspring of such\ncrosses would almost certainly gain in vigour so that even an occasional\ncross would produce more effect than might at first have been anticipated\nTo give a few examples: in the Galapagos Islands nearly every landbird\nbut only two out of the eleven marine birds are peculiar and it is\nobvious that marine birds could arrive at these islands more easily than\nlandbirds Bermuda on the other hand which lies at about the same\ndistance from North America as the Galapagos Islands do from South America\nand which has a very peculiar soil does not possess one endemic landbird\nand we know from Mr J M Joness admirable account of Bermuda that very\nmany North American birds during their great annual migrations visit\neither periodically or occasionally this island Madeira does not possess\none peculiar bird and many European and African birds are almost every\nyear blown there as I am informed by Mr E V Harcourt So that these two\nislands of Bermuda and Madeira have been stocked by birds which for long\nages have struggled together in their former homes and have become\nmutually adapted to each other and when settled in their new homes each\nkind will have been kept by the others to their proper places and habits\nand will consequently have been little liable to modification Any tendency\nto modification will also have been checked by intercrossing with the\nunmodified immigrants from the mothercountry Madeira again is inhabited\nby a wonderful number of peculiar landshells whereas not one species of\nseashell is confined to its shores: now though we do not know how\nseashells are dispersed yet we can see that their eggs or larvae perhaps\nattached to seaweed or floating timber or to the feet of wadingbirds\nmight be transported far more easily than 392 landshells across three\nor four hundred miles of open sea The different orders of insects in\nMadeira apparently present analogous facts\n\nOceanic islands are sometimes deficient in certain classes and their\nplaces are apparently occupied by the other inhabitants in the Galapagos\nIslands reptiles and in New Zealand gigantic wingless birds take the\nplace of mammals In the plants of the Galapagos Islands Dr Hooker has\nshown that the proportional numbers of the different orders are very\ndifferent from what they are elsewhere Such cases are generally accounted\nfor by the physical conditions of the islands but this explanation seems\nto me not a little doubtful Facility of immigration I believe has been\nat least as important as the nature of the conditions\n\nMany remarkable little facts could be given with respect to the inhabitants\nof remote islands For instance in certain islands not tenanted by\nmammals some of the endemic plants have beautifully hooked seeds yet few\nrelations are more striking than the adaptation of hooked seeds for\ntransportal by the wool and fur of quadrupeds This case presents no\ndifficulty on my view for a hooked seed might be transported to an island\nby some other means and the plant then becoming slightly modified but\nstill retaining its hooked seeds would form an endemic species having as\nuseless an appendage as any rudimentary organfor instance as the\nshrivelled wings under the soldered elytra of many insular beetles Again\nislands often possess trees or bushes belonging to orders which elsewhere\ninclude only herbaceous species now trees as Alph de Candolle has shown\ngenerally have whatever the cause may be confined ranges Hence trees\nwould be little likely to reach distant oceanic islands and an herbaceous\nplant though it would have no chance of 393 successfully competing in\nstature with a fully developed tree when established on an island and\nhaving to compete with herbaceous plants alone might readily gain an\nadvantage by growing taller and taller and overtopping the other plants If\nso natural selection would often tend to add to the stature of herbaceous\nplants when growing on an oceanic island to whatever order they belonged\nand thus convert them first into bushes and ultimately into trees\n\nWith respect to the absence of whole orders on oceanic islands Bory St\nVincent long ago remarked that Batrachians frogs toads newts have never\nbeen found on any of the many islands with which the great oceans are\nstudded I have taken pains to verify this assertion and I have found it\nstrictly true I have however been assured that a frog exists on the\nmountains of the great island of New Zealand but I suspect that this\nexception if the information be correct may be explained through glacial\nagency This general absence of frogs toads and newts on so many oceanic\nislands cannot be accounted for by their physical conditions indeed it\nseems that islands are peculiarly well fitted for these animals for frogs\nhave been introduced into Madeira the Azores and Mauritius and have\nmultiplied so as to become a nuisance But as these animals and their spawn\nare known to be immediately killed by seawater on my view we can see that\nthere would be great difficulty in their transportal across the sea and\ntherefore why they do not exist on any oceanic island But why on the\ntheory of creation they should not have been created there it would be\nvery difficult to explain\n\nMammals offer another and similar case I have carefully searched the\noldest voyages but have not finished my search as yet I have not found a\nsingle 394 instance free from doubt of a terrestrial mammal excluding\ndomesticated animals kept by the natives inhabiting an island situated\nabove 300 miles from a continent or great continental island and many\nislands situated at a much less distance are equally barren The Falkland\nIslands which are inhabited by a wolflike fox come nearest to an\nexception but this group cannot be considered as oceanic as it lies on a\nbank connected with the mainland moreover icebergs formerly brought\nboulders to its western shores and they may have formerly transported\nfoxes as so frequently now happens in the arctic regions Yet it cannot be\nsaid that small islands will not support small mammals for they occur in\nmany parts of the world on very small islands if close to a continent and\nhardly an island can be named on which our smaller quadrupeds have not\nbecome naturalised and greatly multiplied It cannot be said on the\nordinary view of creation that there has not been time for the creation of\nmammals many volcanic islands are sufficiently ancient as shown by the\nstupendous degradation which they have suffered and by their tertiary\nstrata: there has also been time for the production of endemic species\nbelonging to other classes and on continents it is thought that mammals\nappear and disappear at a quicker rate than other and lower animals Though\nterrestrial mammals do not occur on oceanic islands arial mammals do\noccur on almost every island New Zealand possesses two bats found nowhere\nelse in the world: Norfolk Island the Viti Archipelago the Bonin Islands\nthe Caroline and Marianne Archipelagoes and Mauritius all possess their\npeculiar bats Why it may be asked has the supposed creative force\nproduced bats and no other mammals on remote islands On my view this\nquestion can easily be answered for no 395 terrestrial mammal can be\ntransported across a wide space of sea but bats can fly across Bats have\nbeen seen wandering by day far over the Atlantic Ocean and two North\nAmerican species either regularly or occasionally visit Bermuda at the\ndistance of 600 miles from the mainland I hear from Mr Tomes who has\nspecially studied this family that many of the same species have enormous\nranges and are found on continents and on far distant islands Hence we\nhave only to suppose that such wandering species have been modified through\nnatural selection in their new homes in relation to their new position and\nwe can understand the presence of endemic bats on islands with the absence\nof all terrestrial mammals\n\nBesides the absence of terrestrial mammals in relation to the remoteness of\nislands from continents there is also a relation to a certain extent\nindependent of distance between the depth of the sea separating an island\nfrom the neighbouring mainland and the presence in both of the same\nmammiferous species or of allied species in a more or less modified\ncondition Mr Windsor Earl has made some striking observations on this\nhead in regard to the great Malay Archipelago which is traversed near\nCelebes by a space of deep ocean and this space separates two widely\ndistinct mammalian faunas On either side the islands are situated on\nmoderately deep submarine banks and they are inhabited by closely allied\nor identical quadrupeds No doubt some few anomalies occur in this great\narchipelago and there is much difficulty in forming a judgment in some\ncases owing to the probable naturalisation of certain mammals through mans\nagency but we shall soon have much light thrown on the natural history of\nthis archipelago by the admirable zeal and researches of Mr Wallace I\nhave not as yet had time to 396 follow up this subject in all other\nquarters of the world but as far as I have gone the relation generally\nholds good We see Britain separated by a shallow channel from Europe and\nthe mammals are the same on both sides we meet with analogous facts on\nmany islands separated by similar channels from Australia The West Indian\nIslands stand on a deeply submerged bank nearly 1000 fathoms in depth and\nhere we find American forms but the species and even the genera are\ndistinct As the amount of modification in all cases depends to a certain\ndegree on the lapse of time and as during changes of level it is obvious\nthat islands separated by shallow channels are more likely to have been\ncontinuously united within a recent period to the mainland than islands\nseparated by deeper channels we can understand the frequent relation\nbetween the depth of the sea and the degree of affinity of the mammalian\ninhabitants of islands with those of a neighbouring continentan\ninexplicable relation on the view of independent acts of creation\n\nAll the foregoing remarks on the inhabitants of oceanic islandsnamely\nthe scarcity of kindsthe richness in endemic forms in particular classes\nor sections of classesthe absence of whole groups as of batrachians\nand of terrestrial mammals notwithstanding the presence of arial\nbatsthe singular proportions of certain orders of plantsherbaceous\nforms having been developed into trees cseem to me to accord better\nwith the view of occasional means of transport having been largely\nefficient in the long course of time than with the view of all our oceanic\nislands having been formerly connected by continuous land with the nearest\ncontinent for on this latter view the migration would probably have been\nmore complete and if modification be admitted all the forms of life would\nhave been more 397 equally modified in accordance with the paramount\nimportance of the relation of organism to organism\n\nI do not deny that there are many and grave difficulties in understanding\nhow several of the inhabitants of the more remote islands whether still\nretaining the same specific form or modified since their arrival could\nhave reached their present homes But the probability of many islands\nhaving existed as haltingplaces of which not a wreck now remains must\nnot be overlooked I will here give a single instance of one of the cases\nof difficulty Almost all oceanic islands even the most isolated and\nsmallest are inhabited by landshells generally by endemic species but\nsometimes by species found elsewhere Dr Aug A Gould has given several\ninteresting cases in regard to the landshells of the islands of the\nPacific Now it is notorious that landshells are very easily killed by\nsalt their eggs at least such as I have tried sink in seawater and are\nkilled by it Yet there must be on my view some unknown but highly\nefficient means for their transportal Would the justhatched young\noccasionally crawl on and adhere to the feet of birds roosting on the\nground and thus get transported It occurred to me that landshells when\nhybernating and having a membranous diaphragm over the mouth of the shell\nmight be floated in chinks of drifted timber across moderately wide arms of\nthe sea And I found that several species did in this state withstand\nuninjured an immersion in seawater during seven days: one of these shells\nwas the Helix pomatia and after it had again hybernated I put it in\nseawater for twenty days and it perfectly recovered As this species has\na thick calcareous operculum I removed it and when it had formed a new\nmembranous one I immersed it for fourteen days in seawater and it\nrecovered and crawled away: but more experiments are wanted on this head\n398\n\nThe most striking and important fact for us in regard to the inhabitants of\nislands is their affinity to those of the nearest mainland without being\nactually the same species Numerous instances could be given of this fact\nI will give only one that of the Galapagos Archipelago situated under the\nequator between 500 and 600 miles from the shores of South America Here\nalmost every product of the land and water bears the unmistakeable stamp of\nthe American continent There are twentysix landbirds and twentyfive of\nthese are ranked by Mr Gould as distinct species supposed to have been\ncreated here yet the close affinity of most of these birds to American\nspecies in every character in their habits gestures and tones of voice\nwas manifest So it is with the other animals and with nearly all the\nplants as shown by Dr Hooker in his admirable memoir on the Flora of this\narchipelago The naturalist looking at the inhabitants of these volcanic\nislands in the Pacific distant several hundred miles from the continent\nyet feels that he is standing on American land Why should this be so why\nshould the species which are supposed to have been created in the Galapagos\nArchipelago and nowhere else bear so plain a stamp of affinity to those\ncreated in America There is nothing in the conditions of life in the\ngeological nature of the islands in their height or climate or in the\nproportions in which the several classes are associated together which\nresembles closely the conditions of the South American coast: in fact there\nis a considerable dissimilarity in all these respects On the other hand\nthere is a considerable degree of resemblance in the volcanic nature of the\nsoil in climate height and size of the islands between the Galapagos\nand Cape de Verde Archipelagos: but what an entire and absolute difference\nin their inhabitants The inhabitants of the Cape de Verde Islands are\nrelated to 399 those of Africa like those of the Galapagos to America I\nbelieve this grand fact can receive no sort of explanation on the ordinary\nview of independent creation whereas on the view here maintained it is\nobvious that the Galapagos Islands would be likely to receive colonists\nwhether by occasional means of transport or by formerly continuous land\nfrom America and the Cape de Verde Islands from Africa and that such\ncolonists would be liable to modificationthe principle of inheritance\nstill betraying their original birthplace\n\nMany analogous facts could be given: indeed it is an almost universal rule\nthat the endemic productions of islands are related to those of the nearest\ncontinent or of other near islands The exceptions are few and most of\nthem can be explained Thus the plants of Kerguelen Land though standing\nnearer to Africa than to America are related and that very closely as we\nknow from Dr Hookers account to those of America: but on the view that\nthis island has been mainly stocked by seeds brought with earth and stones\non icebergs drifted by the prevailing currents this anomaly disappears\nNew Zealand in its endemic plants is much more closely related to\nAustralia the nearest mainland than to any other region: and this is what\nmight have been expected but it is also plainly related to South America\nwhich although the next nearest continent is so enormously remote that\nthe fact becomes an anomaly But this difficulty almost disappears on the\nview that both New Zealand South America and other southern lands were\nlong ago partially stocked from a nearly intermediate though distant point\nnamely from the antarctic islands when they were clothed with vegetation\nbefore the commencement of the Glacial period The affinity which though\nfeeble I am assured by Dr Hooker is real between the flora of the\nsouthwestern corner of Australia and of the Cape of Good 400 Hope is a\nfar more remarkable case and is at present inexplicable: but this affinity\nis confined to the plants and will I do not doubt be some day explained\n\nThe law which causes the inhabitants of an archipelago though specifically\ndistinct to be closely allied to those of the nearest continent we\nsometimes see displayed on a small scale yet in a most interesting manner\nwithin the limits of the same archipelago Thus the several islands of the\nGalapagos Archipelago are tenanted as I have elsewhere shown in a quite\nmarvellous manner by very closely related species so that the inhabitants\nof each separate island though mostly distinct are related in an\nincomparably closer degree to each other than to the inhabitants of any\nother part of the world And this is just what might have been expected on\nmy view for the islands are situated so near each other that they would\nalmost certainly receive immigrants from the same original source or from\neach other But this dissimilarity between the endemic inhabitants of the\nislands may be used as an argument against my views for it may be asked\nhow has it happened in the several islands situated within sight of each\nother having the same geological nature the same height climate c\nthat many of the immigrants should have been differently modified though\nonly in a small degree This long appeared to me a great difficulty: but it\narises in chief part from the deeplyseated error of considering the\nphysical conditions of a country as the most important for its inhabitants\nwhereas it cannot I think be disputed that the nature of the other\ninhabitants with which each has to compete is as least as important and\ngenerally a far more important element of success Now if we look to those\ninhabitants of the Galapagos Archipelago which are found in other parts of\nthe world laying on one side for the moment the 401 endemic species\nwhich cannot be here fairly included as we are considering how they have\ncome to be modified since their arrival we find a considerable amount of\ndifference in the several islands This difference might indeed have been\nexpected on the view of the islands having been stocked by occasional means\nof transporta seed for instance of one plant having been brought to one\nisland and that of another plant to another island Hence when in former\ntimes an immigrant settled on any one or more of the islands or when it\nsubsequently spread from one island to another it would undoubtedly be\nexposed to different conditions of life in the different islands for it\nwould have to compete with different sets of organisms: a plant for\ninstance would find the bestfitted ground more perfectly occupied by\ndistinct plants in one island than in another and it would be exposed to\nthe attacks of somewhat different enemies If then it varied natural\nselection would probably favour different varieties in the different\nislands Some species however might spread and yet retain the same\ncharacter throughout the group just as we see on continents some species\nspreading widely and remaining the same\n\nThe really surprising fact in this case of the Galapagos Archipelago and\nin a lesser degree in some analogous instances is that the new species\nformed in the separate islands have not quickly spread to the other\nislands But the islands though in sight of each other are separated by\ndeep arms of the sea in most cases wider than the British Channel and\nthere is no reason to suppose that they have at any former period been\ncontinuously united The currents of the sea are rapid and sweep across the\narchipelago and gales of wind are extraordinarily rare so that the\nislands are far more effectually separated from each other than they appear\nto be on a map Nevertheless a good many 402 species both those found in\nother parts of the world and those confined to the archipelago are common\nto the several islands and we may infer from certain facts that these have\nprobably spread from some one island to the others But we often take I\nthink an erroneous view of the probability of closelyallied species\ninvading each others territory when put into free intercommunication\nUndoubtedly if one species has any advantage whatever over another it will\nin a very brief time wholly or in part supplant it but if both are equally\nwell fitted for their own places in nature both probably will hold their\nown places and keep separate for almost any length of time Being familiar\nwith the fact that many species naturalised through mans agency have\nspread with astonishing rapidity over new countries we are apt to infer\nthat most species would thus spread but we should remember that the forms\nwhich become naturalised in new countries are not generally closely allied\nto the aboriginal inhabitants but are very distinct species belonging in\na large proportion of cases as shown by Alph de Candolle to distinct\ngenera In the Galapagos Archipelago many even of the birds though so\nwell adapted for flying from island to island are distinct on each thus\nthere are three closelyallied species of mockingthrush each confined to\nits own island Now let us suppose the mockingthrush of Chatham Island to\nbe blown to Charles Island which has its own mockingthrush: why should it\nsucceed in establishing itself there We may safely infer that Charles\nIsland is well stocked with its own species for annually more eggs are\nlaid there than can possibly be reared and we may infer that the\nmockingthrush peculiar to Charles Island is at least as well fitted for\nits home as is the species peculiar to Chatham Island Sir C Lyell and Mr\nWollaston have communicated to me a remarkable fact bearing on this 403\nsubject namely that Madeira and the adjoining islet of Porto Santo\npossess many distinct but representative landshells some of which live in\ncrevices of stone and although large quantities of stone are annually\ntransported from Porto Santo to Madeira yet this latter island has not\nbecome colonised by the Porto Santo species: nevertheless both islands have\nbeen colonised by some European landshells which no doubt had some\nadvantage over the indigenous species From these considerations I think we\nneed not greatly marvel at the endemic and representative species which\ninhabit the several islands of the Galapagos Archipelago not having\nuniversally spread from island to island In many other instances as in\nthe several districts of the same continent preoccupation has probably\nplayed an important part in checking the commingling of species under the\nsame conditions of life Thus the southeast and southwest corners of\nAustralia have nearly the same physical conditions and are united by\ncontinuous land yet they are inhabited by a vast number of distinct\nmammals birds and plants\n\nThe principle which determines the general character of the fauna and flora\nof oceanic islands namely that the inhabitants when not identically the\nsame yet are plainly related to the inhabitants of that region whence\ncolonists could most readily have been derivedthe colonists having been\nsubsequently modified and better fitted to their new homesis of the\nwidest application throughout nature We see this on every mountain in\nevery lake and marsh For Alpine species excepting in so far as the same\nforms chiefly of plants have spread widely throughout the world during\nthe recent Glacial epoch are related to those of the surrounding\nlowlandsthus we have in South America Alpine hummingbirds Alpine\nrodents Alpine plants 404 c all of strictly American forms and it\nis obvious that a mountain as it became slowly upheaved would naturally\nbe colonised from the surrounding lowlands So it is with the inhabitants\nof lakes and marshes excepting in so far as great facility of transport\nhas given the same general forms to the whole world We see this same\nprinciple in the blind animals inhabiting the caves of America and of\nEurope Other analogous facts could be given And it will I believe be\nuniversally found to be true that wherever in two regions let them be\never so distant many closelyallied or representative species occur there\nwill likewise be found some identical species showing in accordance with\nthe foregoing view that at some former period there has been\nintercommunication or migration between the two regions And wherever many\ncloselyallied species occur there will be found many forms which some\nnaturalists rank as distinct species and some as varieties these doubtful\nforms showing us the steps in the process of modification\n\nThis relation between the power and extent of migration of a species\neither at the present time or at some former period under different\nphysical conditions and the existence at remote points of the world of\nother species allied to it is shown in another and more general way Mr\nGould remarked to me long ago that in those genera of birds which range\nover the world many of the species have very wide ranges I can hardly\ndoubt that this rule is generally true though it would be difficult to\nprove it Amongst mammals we see it strikingly displayed in Bats and in a\nlesser degree in the Felid and Canid We see it if we compare the\ndistribution of butterflies and beetles So it is with most freshwater\nproductions in which so many genera range over the world and many\nindividual species have 405 enormous ranges It is not meant that in\nworldranging genera all the species have a wide range or even that they\nhave on an average a wide range but only that some of the species range\nvery widely for the facility with which widelyranging species vary and\ngive rise to new forms will largely determine their average range For\ninstance two varieties of the same species inhabit America and Europe and\nthe species thus has an immense range but if the variation had been a\nlittle greater the two varieties would have been ranked as distinct\nspecies and the common range would have been greatly reduced Still less\nis it meant that a species which apparently has the capacity of crossing\nbarriers and ranging widely as in the case of certain powerfullywinged\nbirds will necessarily range widely for we should never forget that to\nrange widely implies not only the power of crossing barriers but the more\nimportant power of being victorious in distant lands in the struggle for\nlife with foreign associates But on the view of all the species of a genus\nhaving descended from a single parent though now distributed to the most\nremote points of the world we ought to find and I believe as a general\nrule we do find that some at least of the species range very widely for\nit is necessary that the unmodified parent should range widely undergoing\nmodification during its diffusion and should place itself under diverse\nconditions favourable for the conversion of its offspring firstly into new\nvarieties and ultimately into new species\n\nIn considering the wide distribution of certain genera we should bear in\nmind that some are extremely ancient and must have branched off from a\ncommon parent at a remote epoch so that in such cases there will have been\nample time for great climatal and geographical changes and for accidents of\ntransport and consequently for the migration of some of the species into\nall 406 quarters of the world where they may have become slightly\nmodified in relation to their new conditions There is also some reason\nto believe from geological evidence that organisms low in the scale within\neach great class generally change at a slower rate than the higher forms\nand consequently the lower forms will have had a better chance of ranging\nwidely and of still retaining the same specific character This fact\ntogether with the seeds and eggs of many low forms being very minute and\nbetter fitted for distant transportation probably accounts for a law which\nhas long been observed and which has lately been admirably discussed by\nAlph de Candolle in regard to plants namely that the lower any group of\norganisms is the more widely it is apt to range\n\nThe relations just discussednamely low and slowlychanging organisms\nranging more widely than the highsome of the species of widelyranging\ngenera themselves ranging widelysuch facts as alpine lacustrine and\nmarsh productions being related with the exceptions before specified to\nthose on the surrounding low lands and dry lands though these stations are\nso differentthe very close relation of the distinct species which\ninhabit the islets of the same archipelagoand especially the striking\nrelation of the inhabitants of each whole archipelago or island to those of\nthe nearest mainlandare I think utterly inexplicable on the ordinary\nview of the independent creation of each species but are explicable on the\nview of colonisation from the nearest or readiest source together with the\nsubsequent modification and better adaptation of the colonists to their new\nhomes\n\n\n\nSummary of last and present ChaptersIn these chapters I have\nendeavoured to show that if we make due allowance for our ignorance of the\nfull effects of all 407 the changes of climate and of the level of the\nland which have certainly occurred within the recent period and of other\nsimilar changes which may have occurred within the same period if we\nremember how profoundly ignorant we are with respect to the many and\ncurious means of occasional transporta subject which has hardly ever\nbeen properly experimentised on if we bear in mind how often a species may\nhave ranged continuously over a wide area and then have become extinct in\nthe intermediate tracts I think the difficulties in believing that all the\nindividuals of the same species wherever located have descended from the\nsame parents are not insuperable And we are led to this conclusion which\nhas been arrived at by many naturalists under the designation of single\ncentres of creation by some general considerations more especially from\nthe importance of barriers and from the analogical distribution of\nsubgenera genera and families\n\nWith respect to the distinct species of the same genus which on my theory\nmust have spread from one parentsource if we make the same allowances as\nbefore for our ignorance and remember that some forms of life change most\nslowly enormous periods of time being thus granted for their migration I\ndo not think that the difficulties are insuperable though they often are\nin this case and in that of the individuals of the same species extremely\ngreat\n\nAs exemplifying the effects of climatal changes on distribution I have\nattempted to show how important has been the influence of the modern\nGlacial period which I am fully convinced simultaneously affected the\nwhole world or at least great meridional belts As showing how diversified\nare the means of occasional transport I have discussed at some little\nlength the means of dispersal of freshwater productions 408\n\nIf the difficulties be not insuperable in admitting that in the long course\nof time the individuals of the same species and likewise of allied\nspecies have proceeded from some one source then I think all the grand\nleading facts of geographical distribution are explicable on the theory of\nmigration generally of the more dominant forms of life together with\nsubsequent modification and the multiplication of new forms We can thus\nunderstand the high importance of barriers whether of land or water which\nseparate our several zoological and botanical provinces We can thus\nunderstand the localisation of subgenera genera and families and how it\nis that under different latitudes for instance in South America the\ninhabitants of the plains and mountains of the forests marshes and\ndeserts are in so mysterious a manner linked together by affinity and are\nlikewise linked to the extinct beings which formerly inhabited the same\ncontinent Bearing in mind that the mutual relation of organism to organism\nis of the highest importance we can see why two areas having nearly the\nsame physical conditions should often be inhabited by very different forms\nof life for according to the length of time which has elapsed since new\ninhabitants entered one region according to the nature of the\ncommunication which allowed certain forms and not others to enter either\nin greater or lesser numbers according or not as those which entered\nhappened to come in more or less direct competition with each other and\nwith the aborigines and according as the immigrants were capable of\nvarying more or less rapidly there would ensue in different regions\nindependently of their physical conditions infinitely diversified\nconditions of lifethere would be an almost endless amount of organic\naction and reactionand we should find as we do find some groups of\nbeings greatly and some only slightly modifiedsome 409 developed in\ngreat force some existing in scanty numbersin the different great\ngeographical provinces of the world\n\nOn these same principles we can understand as I have endeavoured to show\nwhy oceanic islands should have few inhabitants but of these a great\nnumber should be endemic or peculiar and why in relation to the means of\nmigration one group of beings even within the same class should have all\nits species endemic and another group should have all its species common\nto other quarters of the world We can see why whole groups of organisms\nas batrachians and terrestrial mammals should be absent from oceanic\nislands whilst the most isolated islands possess their own peculiar\nspecies of arial mammals or bats We can see why there should be some\nrelation between the presence of mammals in a more or less modified\ncondition and the depth of the sea between an island and the mainland We\ncan clearly see why all the inhabitants of an archipelago though\nspecifically distinct on the several islets should be closely related to\neach other and likewise be related but less closely to those of the\nnearest continent or other source whence immigrants were probably derived\nWe can see why in two areas however distant from each other there should\nbe a correlation in the presence of identical species of varieties of\ndoubtful species and of distinct but representative species\n\nAs the late Edward Forbes often insisted there is a striking parallelism\nin the laws of life throughout time and space: the laws governing the\nsuccession of forms in past times being nearly the same with those\ngoverning at the present time the differences in different areas We see\nthis in many facts The endurance of each species and group of species is\ncontinuous in time for the exceptions to the rule are so few that they\nmay 410 fairly be attributed to our not having as yet discovered in an\nintermediate deposit the forms which are therein absent but which occur\nabove and below: so in space it certainly is the general rule that the\narea inhabited by a single species or by a group of species is\ncontinuous and the exceptions which are not rare may as I have\nattempted to show be accounted for by migration at some former period\nunder different conditions or by occasional means of transport and by the\nspecies having become extinct in the intermediate tracts Both in time and\nspace species and groups of species have their points of maximum\ndevelopment Groups of species belonging either to a certain period of\ntime or to a certain area are often characterised by trifling characters\nin common as of sculpture or colour In looking to the long succession of\nages as in now looking to distant provinces throughout the world we find\nthat some organisms differ little whilst others belonging to a different\nclass or to a different order or even only to a different family of the\nsame order differ greatly In both time and space the lower members of\neach class generally change less than the higher but there are in both\ncases marked exceptions to the rule On my theory these several relations\nthroughout time and space are intelligible for whether we look to the\nforms of life which have changed during successive ages within the same\nquarter of the world or to those which have changed after having migrated\ninto distant quarters in both cases the forms within each class have been\nconnected by the same bond of ordinary generation and the more nearly any\ntwo forms are related in blood the nearer they will generally stand to\neach other in time and space in both cases the laws of variation have been\nthe same and modifications have been accumulated by the same power of\nnatural selection\n\n                                   \n\n\n411\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nMUTUAL

and being inherited at a corresponding\n    ageRUDIMENTARY ORGANS their origin explainedSummary\n\nFrom the first dawn of life all organic beings are found to resemble each\nother in descending degrees so that they can be classed in groups under\ngroups This classification is evidently not arbitrary like the grouping of\nthe stars in constellations The existence of groups would have been of\nsimple signification if one group had been exclusively fitted to inhabit\nthe land and another the water one to feed on flesh another on vegetable\nmatter and so on but the case is widely different in nature for it is\nnotorious how commonly members of even the same subgroup have different\nhabits In our second and fourth chapters on Variation and on Natural\nSelection I have attempted to show that it is the widely ranging the much\ndiffused and common that is the dominant species belonging to the larger\ngenera which vary most The varieties or incipient species thus produced\nultimately become converted as I believe into new and distinct species\nand these on the principle of inheritance tend to produce other new and\ndominant 412 species Consequently the groups which are now large and\nwhich generally include many dominant species tend to go on increasing\nindefinitely in size I further attempted to show that from the varying\ndescendants of each species trying to occupy as many and as different\nplaces as possible in the economy of nature there is a constant tendency\nin their characters to diverge This conclusion was supported by looking at\nthe great diversity of the forms of life which in any small area come\ninto the closest competition and by looking to certain facts in\nnaturalisation\n\nI attempted also to show that there is a constant tendency in the forms\nwhich are increasing in number and diverging in character to supplant and\nexterminate the less divergent the less improved and preceding forms I\nrequest the reader to turn to the diagram illustrating the action as\nformerly explained of these several principles and he will see that the\ninevitable result is that the modified descendants proceeding from one\nprogenitor become broken up into groups subordinate to groups In the\ndiagram each letter on the uppermost line may represent a genus including\nseveral species and all the genera on this line form together one class\nfor all have descended from one ancient but unseen parent and\nconsequently have inherited something in common But the three genera on\nthe left hand have on this same principle much in common and form a\nsubfamily distinct from that including the next two genera on the right\nhand which diverged from a common parent at the fifth stage of descent\nThese five genera have also much though less in common and they form a\nfamily distinct from that including the three genera still further to the\nright hand which diverged at a still earlier period And all these genera\ndescended from A form an order distinct from the 413 genera descended\nfrom I So that we here have many species descended from a single\nprogenitor grouped into genera and the genera are included in or\nsubordinate to subfamilies families and orders all united into one\nclass Thus the grand fact in natural history of the subordination of\ngroup under group which from its familiarity does not always\nsufficiently strike us is in my judgment explained\n\nNaturalists try to arrange the species genera and families in each class\non what is called the Natural System But what is meant by this system\nSome authors look at it merely as a scheme for arranging together those\nliving objects which are most alike and for separating those which are\nmost unlike or as an artificial means for enunciating as briefly as\npossible general propositionsthat is by one sentence to give the\ncharacters common for instance to all mammals by another those common to\nall carnivora by another those common to the doggenus and then by adding\na single sentence a full description is given of each kind of dog The\ningenuity and utility of this system are indisputable But many naturalists\nthink that something more is meant by the Natural System they believe that\nit reveals the plan of the Creator but unless it be specified whether\norder in time or space or what else is meant by the plan of the Creator\nit seems to me that nothing is thus added to our knowledge Such\nexpressions as that famous one of Linnus and which we often meet with in\na more or less concealed form that the characters do not make the genus\nbut that the genus gives the characters seem to imply that something more\nis included in our classification than mere resemblance I believe that\nsomething more is included and that propinquity of descentthe only\nknown cause of the similarity of organic beingsis the bond hidden as it\nis by various degrees of 414 modification which is partially revealed to\nus by our classifications\n\nLet us now consider the rules followed in classification and the\ndifficulties which are encountered on the view that classification either\ngives some unknown plan of creation or is simply a scheme for enunciating\ngeneral propositions and of placing together the forms most like each\nother It might have been thought and was in ancient times thought that\nthose parts of the structure which determined the habits of life and the\ngeneral place of each being in the economy of nature would be of very high\nimportance in classification Nothing can be more false No one regards the\nexternal similarity of a mouse to a shrew of a dugong to a whale of a\nwhale to a fish as of any importance These resemblances though so\nintimately connected with the whole life of the being are ranked as merely\nadaptive or analogical characters but to the consideration of these\nresemblances we shall have to recur It may even be given as a general\nrule that the less any part of the organisation is concerned with special\nhabits the more important it becomes for classification As an instance:\nOwen in speaking of the dugong says The generative organs being those\nwhich are most remotely related to the habits and food of an animal I have\nalways regarded as affording very clear indications of its true affinities\nWe are least likely in the modifications of these organs to mistake a\nmerely adaptive for an essential character So with plants how remarkable\nit is that the organs of vegetation on which their whole life depends are\nof little signification excepting in the first main divisions whereas the\norgans of reproduction with their product the seed are of paramount\nimportance\n\nWe must not therefore in classifying trust to resemblances in parts of\nthe organisation however important 415 they may be for the welfare of\nthe being in relation to the outer world Perhaps from this cause it has\npartly arisen that almost all naturalists lay the greatest stress on\nresemblances in organs of high vital or physiological importance No doubt\nthis view of the classificatory importance of organs which are important is\ngenerally but by no means always true But their importance for\nclassification I believe depends on their greater constancy throughout\nlarge groups of species and this constancy depends on such organs having\ngenerally been subjected to less change in the adaptation of the species to\ntheir conditions of life That the mere physiological importance of an\norgan does not determine its classificatory value is almost shown by the\none fact that in allied groups in which the same organ as we have every\nreason to suppose has nearly the same physiological value its\nclassificatory value is widely different No naturalist can have worked at\nany group without being struck with this fact and it has been fully\nacknowledged in the writings of almost every author It will suffice to\nquote the highest authority Robert Brown who in speaking of certain\norgans in the Proteace says their generic importance like that of all\ntheir parts not only in this but as I apprehend in every natural family\nis very unequal and in some cases seems to be entirely lost Again in\nanother work he says the genera of the Connarace differ in having one or\nmore ovaria in the existence or absence of albumen in the imbricate or\nvalvular stivation Any one of these characters singly is frequently of\nmore than generic importance though here even when all taken together they\nappear insufficient to separate Cnestis from Connarus To give an example\namongst insects in one great division of the Hymenoptera the antenn as\nWestwood has remarked are most constant in structure 416 in another\ndivision they differ much and the differences are of quite subordinate\nvalue in classification yet no one probably will say that the antennae in\nthese two divisions of the same order are of unequal physiological\nimportance Any number of instances could be given of the varying\nimportance for classification of the same important organ within the same\ngroup of beings\n\nAgain no one will say that rudimentary or atrophied organs are of high\nphysiological or vital importance yet undoubtedly organs in this\ncondition are often of high value in classification No one will dispute\nthat the rudimentary teeth in the upper jaws of young ruminants and\ncertain rudimentary bones of the leg are highly serviceable in exhibiting\nthe close affinity between Ruminants and Pachyderms Robert Brown has\nstrongly insisted on the fact that the rudimentary florets are of the\nhighest importance in the classification of the Grasses\n\nNumerous instances could be given of characters derived from parts which\nmust be considered of very trifling physiological importance but which are\nuniversally admitted as highly serviceable in the definition of whole\ngroups For instance whether or not there is an open passage from the\nnostrils to the mouth the only character according to Owen which\nabsolutely distinguishes fishes and reptilesthe inflection of the angle\nof the jaws in Marsupialsthe manner in which the wings of insects are\nfoldedmere colour in certain Algmere pubescence on parts of the flower\nin grassesthe nature of the dermal covering as hair or feathers in the\nVertebrata If the Ornithorhynchus had been covered with feathers instead\nof hair this external and trifling character would I think have been\nconsidered by naturalists as important an aid in determining the degree of\naffinity of this strange creature to 417 birds and reptiles as an\napproach in structure in any one internal and important organ\n\nThe importance for classification of trifling characters mainly depends\non their being correlated with several other characters of more or less\nimportance The value indeed of an aggregate of characters is very evident\nin natural history Hence as has often been remarked a species may depart\nfrom its allies in several characters both of high physiological\nimportance and of almost universal prevalence and yet leave us in no doubt\nwhere it should be ranked Hence also it has been found that a\nclassification founded on any single character however important that may\nbe has always failed for no part of the organisation is universally\nconstant The importance of an aggregate of characters even when none are\nimportant alone explains I think that saying of Linnus that the\ncharacters do not give the genus but the genus gives the characters for\nthis saying seems founded on an appreciation of many trifling points of\nresemblance too slight to be defined Certain plants belonging to the\nMalpighiace bear perfect and degraded flowers in the latter as A de\nJussieu has remarked the greater number of the characters proper to the\nspecies to the genus to the family to the class disappear and thus\nlaugh at our classification But when Aspicarpa produced in France during\nseveral years only degraded flowers departing so wonderfully in a number\nof the most important points of structure from the proper type of the\norder yet M Richard sagaciously saw as Jussieu observes that this genus\nshould still be retained amongst the Malpighiace This case seems to me\nwell to illustrate the spirit with which our classifications are sometimes\nnecessarily founded\n\nPractically when naturalists are at work they do 418 not trouble\nthemselves about the physiological value of the characters which they use\nin defining a group or in allocating any particular species If they find\na character nearly uniform and common to a great number of forms and not\ncommon to others they use it as one of high value if common to some\nlesser number they use it as of subordinate value This principle has been\nbroadly confessed by some naturalists to be the true one and by none more\nclearly than by that excellent botanist Aug St Hilaire If certain\ncharacters are always found correlated with others though no apparent bond\nof connexion can be discovered between them especial value is set on them\nAs in most groups of animals important organs such as those for\npropelling the blood or for arating it or those for propagating the\nrace are found nearly uniform they are considered as highly serviceable\nin classification but in some groups of animals all these the most\nimportant vital organs are found to offer characters of quite subordinate\nvalue\n\nWe can see why characters derived from the embryo should be of equal\nimportance with those derived from the adult for our classifications of\ncourse include all ages of each species But it is by no means obvious on\nthe ordinary view why the structure of the embryo should be more important\nfor this purpose than that of the adult which alone plays its full part in\nthe economy of nature Yet it has been strongly urged by those great\nnaturalists Milne Edwards and Agassiz that embryonic characters are the\nmost important of any in the classification of animals and this doctrine\nhas very generally been admitted as true The same fact holds good with\nflowering plants of which the two main divisions have been founded on\ncharacters derived from the embryoon the number and position of the\n419 embryonic leaves or cotyledons and on the mode of development of the\nplumule and radicle In our discussion on embryology we shall see why such\ncharacters are so valuable on the view of classification tacitly including\nthe idea of descent\n\nOur classifications are often plainly influenced by chains of affinities\nNothing can be easier than to define a number of characters common to all\nbirds but in the case of crustaceans such definition has hitherto been\nfound impossible There are crustaceans at the opposite ends of the series\nwhich have hardly a character in common yet the species at both ends from\nbeing plainly allied to others and these to others and so onwards can be\nrecognised as unequivocally belonging to this and to no other class of the\nArticulata\n\nGeographical distribution has often been used though perhaps not quite\nlogically in classification more especially in very large groups of\nclosely allied forms Temminck insists on the utility or even necessity of\nthis practice in certain groups of birds and it has been followed by\nseveral entomologists and botanists\n\nFinally with respect to the comparative value of the various groups of\nspecies such as orders suborders families subfamilies and genera\nthey seem to be at least at present almost arbitrary Several of the best\nbotanists such as Mr Bentham and others have strongly insisted on their\narbitrary value Instances could be given amongst plants and insects of a\ngroup of forms first ranked by practised naturalists as only a genus and\nthen raised to the rank of a subfamily or family and this has been done\nnot because further research has detected important structural differences\nat first overlooked but because numerous allied species with slightly\ndifferent grades of difference have been subsequently discovered 420\n\nAll the foregoing rules and aids and difficulties in classification are\nexplained if I do not greatly deceive myself on the view that the natural\nsystem is founded on descent with modification that the characters which\nnaturalists consider as showing true affinity between any two or more\nspecies are those which have been inherited from a common parent and in\nso far all true classification is genealogical that community of descent\nis the hidden bond which naturalists have been unconsciously seeking and\nnot some unknown plan of creation or the enunciation of general\npropositions and the mere putting together and separating objects more or\nless alike\n\nBut I must explain my meaning more fully I believe that the arrangement\nof the groups within each class in due subordination and relation to the\nother groups must be strictly genealogical in order to be natural but\nthat the amount of difference in the several branches or groups though\nallied in the same degree in blood to their common progenitor may differ\ngreatly being due to the different degrees of modification which they have\nundergone and this is expressed by the forms being ranked under different\ngenera families sections or orders The reader will best understand what\nis meant if he will take the trouble of referring to the diagram in the\nfourth chapter We will suppose the letters A to L to represent allied\ngenera which lived during the Silurian epoch and these have descended\nfrom a species which existed at an unknown anterior period Species of\nthree of these genera A F and I have transmitted modified descendants\nto the present day represented by the fifteen genera a14 to z14 on\nthe uppermost horizontal line Now all these modified descendants from a\nsingle species are represented as related in blood or descent to the same\n421 degree they may metaphorically be called cousins to the same\nmillionth degree yet they differ widely and in different degrees from each\nother The forms descended from A now broken up into two or three\nfamilies constitute a distinct order from those descended from I also\nbroken up into two families Nor can the existing species descended from\nA be ranked in the same genus with the parent A or those from I with the\nparent I But the existing genus F14 may be supposed to have been but\nslightly modified and it will then rank with the parentgenus F just as\nsome few still living organic beings belong to Silurian genera So that the\namount or value of the differences between organic beings all related to\neach other in the same degree in blood has come to be widely different\nNevertheless their genealogical arrangement remains strictly true not\nonly at the present time but at each successive period of descent All the\nmodified descendants from A will have inherited something in common from\ntheir common parent as will all the descendants from I so will it be with\neach subordinate branch of descendants at each successive period If\nhowever we choose to suppose that any of the descendants of A or of I have\nbeen so much modified as to have more or less completely lost traces of\ntheir parentage in this case their places in a natural classification\nwill have been more or less completely lostas sometimes seems to have\noccurred with existing organisms All the descendants of the genus F along\nits whole line of descent are supposed to have been but little modified\nand they yet form a single genus But this genus though much isolated\nwill still occupy its proper intermediate position for F originally was\nintermediate in character between A and I and the several genera descended\nfrom these two genera will 422 have inherited to a certain extent their\ncharacters This natural arrangement is shown as far as is possible on\npaper in the diagram but in much too simple a manner If a branching\ndiagram had not been used and only the names of the groups had been\nwritten in a linear series it would have been still less possible to have\ngiven a natural arrangement and it is notoriously not possible to\nrepresent in a series on a flat surface the affinities which we discover\nin nature amongst the beings of the same group Thus on the view which I\nhold the natural system is genealogical in its arrangement like a\npedigree but the degrees of modification which the different groups have\nundergone have to be expressed by ranking them under different socalled\ngenera subfamilies families sections orders and classes\n\nIt may be worth while to illustrate this view of classification by taking\nthe case of languages If we possessed a perfect pedigree of mankind a\ngenealogical arrangement of the races of man would afford the best\nclassification of the various languages now spoken throughout the world\nand if all extinct languages and all intermediate and slowly changing\ndialects had to be included such an arrangement would I think be the\nonly possible one Yet it might be that some very ancient language had\naltered little and had given rise to few new languages whilst others\nowing to the spreading and subsequent isolation and states of civilisation\nof the several races descended from a common race had altered much and\nhad given rise to many new languages and dialects The various degrees of\ndifference in the languages from the same stock would have to be expressed\nby groups subordinate to groups but the proper or even only possible\narrangement would still be genealogical and this would be strictly\nnatural as 423 it would connect together all languages extinct and\nmodern by the closest affinities and would give the filiation and origin\nof each tongue\n\nIn confirmation of this view let us glance at the classification of\nvarieties which are believed or known to have descended from one species\nThese are grouped under species with subvarieties under varieties and\nwith our domestic productions several other grades of difference are\nrequisite as we have seen with pigeons The origin of the existence of\ngroups subordinate to groups is the same with varieties as with species\nnamely closeness of descent with various degrees of modification Nearly\nthe same rules are followed in classifying varieties as with species\nAuthors have insisted on the necessity of classing varieties on a natural\ninstead of an artificial system we are cautioned for instance not to\nclass two varieties of the pineapple together merely because their fruit\nthough the most important part happens to be nearly identical no one puts\nthe swedish and common turnips together though the esculent and thickened\nstems are so similar Whatever part is found to be most constant is used\nin classing varieties: thus the great agriculturist Marshall says the horns\nare very useful for this purpose with cattle because they are less\nvariable than the shape or colour of the body c whereas with sheep the\nhorns are much less serviceable because less constant In classing\nvarieties I apprehend if we had a real pedigree a genealogical\nclassification would be universally preferred and it has been attempted by\nsome authors For we might feel sure whether there had been more or less\nmodification the principle of inheritance would keep the forms together\nwhich were allied in the greatest number of points In tumbler pigeons\nthough some subvarieties differ from the others 424 in the important\ncharacter of having a longer beak yet all are kept together from having\nthe common habit of tumbling but the shortfaced breed has nearly or quite\nlost this habit nevertheless without any reasoning or thinking on the\nsubject these tumblers are kept in the same group because allied in blood\nand alike in some other respects If it could be proved that the Hottentot\nhad descended from the Negro I think he would be classed under the Negro\ngroup however much he might differ in colour and other important\ncharacters from negroes\n\nWith species in a state of nature every naturalist has in fact brought\ndescent into his classification for he includes in his lowest grade or\nthat of a species the two sexes and how enormously these sometimes differ\nin the most important characters is known to every naturalist: scarcely a\nsingle fact can be predicated in common of the males and hermaphrodites of\ncertain cirripedes when adult and yet no one dreams of separating them\nThe naturalist includes as one species the several larval stages of the\nsame individual however much they may differ from each other and from the\nadult as he likewise includes the socalled alternate generations of\nSteenstrup which can only in a technical sense be considered as the same\nindividual He includes monsters he includes varieties not solely because\nthey closely resemble the parentform but because they are descended from\nit He who believes that the cowslip is descended from the primrose or\nconversely ranks them together as a single species and gives a single\ndefinition As soon as three Orchidean forms Monochanthus Myanthus and\nCatasetum which had previously been ranked as three distinct genera were\nknown to be sometimes produced on the same spike they were immediately\nincluded as a single species 425\n\nAs descent has universally been used in classing together the individuals\nof the same species though the males and females and larv are sometimes\nextremely different and as it has been used in classing varieties which\nhave undergone a certain and sometimes a considerable amount of\nmodification may not this same element of descent have been unconsciously\nused in grouping species under genera and genera under higher groups\nthough in these cases the modification has been greater in degree and has\ntaken a longer time to complete I believe it has thus been unconsciously\nused and only thus can I understand the several rules and guides which\nhave been followed by our best systematists We have no written pedigrees\nwe have to make out community of descent by resemblances of any kind\nTherefore we choose those characters which as far as we can judge are the\nleast likely to have been modified in relation to the conditions of life to\nwhich each species has been recently exposed Rudimentary structures on\nthis view are as good as or even sometimes better than other parts of the\norganisation We care not how trifling a character may belet it be the\nmere inflection of the angle of the jaw the manner in which an insects\nwing is folded whether the skin be covered by hair or feathersif it\nprevail throughout many and different species especially those having very\ndifferent habits of life it assumes high value for we can account for its\npresence in so many forms with such different habits only by its\ninheritance from a common parent We may err in this respect in regard to\nsingle points of structure but when several characters let them be ever\nso trifling occur together throughout a large group of beings having\ndifferent habits we may feel almost sure on the theory of descent that\nthese characters have been inherited from a common ancestor 426 And we\nknow that such correlated or aggregated characters have especial value in\nclassification\n\nWe can understand why a species or a group of species may depart in\nseveral of its most important characteristics from its allies and yet be\nsafely classed with them This may be safely done and is often done as\nlong as a sufficient number of characters let them be ever so unimportant\nbetrays the hidden bond of community of descent Let two forms have not a\nsingle character in common yet if these extreme forms are connected\ntogether by a chain of intermediate groups we may at once infer their\ncommunity of descent and we put them all into the same class As we find\norgans of high physiological importancethose which serve to preserve life\nunder the most diverse conditions of existenceare generally the most\nconstant we attach especial value to them but if these same organs in\nanother group or section of a group are found to differ much we at once\nvalue them less in our classification We shall hereafter I think clearly\nsee why embryological characters are of such high classificatory\nimportance Geographical distribution may sometimes be brought usefully\ninto play in classing large and widelydistributed genera because all the\nspecies of the same genus inhabiting any distinct and isolated region\nhave in all probability descended from the same parents\n\nWe can understand on these views the very important distinction between\nreal affinities and analogical or adaptive resemblances Lamarck first\ncalled attention to this distinction and he has been ably followed by\nMacleay and others The resemblance in the shape of the body and in the\nfinlike anterior limbs between the dugong which is a pachydermatous\nanimal and the whale and between both these mammals and fishes is\nanalogical Amongst insects there are innumerable 427 instances: thus\nLinnus misled by external appearances actually classed an homopterous\ninsect as a moth We see something of the same kind even in our domestic\nvarieties as in the thickened stems of the common and swedish turnip The\nresemblance of the greyhound and racehorse is hardly more fanciful than the\nanalogies which have been drawn by some authors between very distinct\nanimals On my view of characters being of real importance for\nclassification only in so far as they reveal descent we can clearly\nunderstand why analogical or adaptive character although of the utmost\nimportance to the welfare of the being are almost valueless to the\nsystematist For animals belonging to two most distinct lines of descent\nmay readily become adapted to similar conditions and thus assume a close\nexternal resemblance but such resemblances will not revealwill rather\ntend to conceal their bloodrelationship to their proper lines of descent\nWe can also understand the apparent paradox that the very same characters\nare analogical when one class or order is compared with another but give\ntrue affinities when the members of the same class or order are compared\none with another: thus the shape of the body and finlike limbs are only\nanalogical when whales are compared with fishes being adaptations in both\nclasses for swimming through the water but the shape of the body and\nfinlike limbs serve as characters exhibiting true affinity between the\nseveral members of the whale family for these cetaceans agree in so many\ncharacters great and small that we cannot doubt that they have inherited\ntheir general shape of body and structure of limbs from a common ancestor\nSo it is with fishes\n\nAs members of distinct classes have often been adapted by successive slight\nmodifications to live under nearly similar circumstancesto inhabit for\ninstance 428 the three elements of land air and waterwe can perhaps\nunderstand how it is that a numerical parallelism has sometimes been\nobserved between the subgroups in distinct classes A naturalist struck\nby a parallelism of this nature in any one class by arbitrarily raising or\nsinking the value of the groups in other classes and all our experience\nshows that this valuation has hitherto been arbitrary could easily extend\nthe parallelism over a wide range and thus the septenary quinary\nquaternary and ternary classifications have probably arisen\n\nAs the modified descendants of dominant species belonging to the larger\ngenera tend to inherit the advantages which made the groups to which they\nbelong large and their parents dominant they are almost sure to spread\nwidely and to seize on more and more places in the economy of nature The\nlarger and more dominant groups thus tend to go on increasing in size and\nthey consequently supplant many smaller and feebler groups Thus we can\naccount for the fact that all organisms recent and extinct are included\nunder a few great orders under still fewer classes and all in one great\nnatural system As showing how few the higher groups are in number and how\nwidely spread they are throughout the world the fact is striking that the\ndiscovery of Australia has not added a single insect belonging to a new\nclass and that in the vegetable kingdom as I learn from Dr Hooker it\nhas added only two or three orders of small size\n\nIn the chapter on geological succession I attempted to show on the\nprinciple of each group having generally diverged much in character during\nthe longcontinued process of modification how it is that the more ancient\nforms of life often present characters in some slight degree intermediate\nbetween existing groups A few 429 old and intermediate parentforms\nhaving occasionally transmitted to the present day descendants but little\nmodified will give to us our socalled osculant or aberrant groups The\nmore aberrant any form is the greater must be the number of connecting\nforms which on my theory have been exterminated and utterly lost And we\nhave some evidence of aberrant forms having suffered severely from\nextinction for they are generally represented by extremely few species\nand such species as do occur are generally very distinct from each other\nwhich again implies extinction The genera Ornithorhynchus and Lepidosiren\nfor example would not have been less aberrant had each been represented by\na dozen species instead of by a single one but such richness in species\nas I find after some investigation does not commonly fall to the lot of\naberrant genera We can I think account for this fact only by looking at\naberrant forms as failing groups conquered by more successful competitors\nwith a few members preserved by some unusual coincidence of favourable\ncircumstances\n\nMr Waterhouse has remarked that when a member belonging to one group of\nanimals exhibits an affinity to a quite distinct group this affinity in\nmost cases is general and not special: thus according to Mr Waterhouse\nof all Rodents the bizcacha is most nearly related to Marsupials but in\nthe points in which it approaches this order its relations are general\nand not to any one marsupial species more than to another As the points of\naffinity of the bizcacha to Marsupials are believed to be real and not\nmerely adaptive they are due on my theory to inheritance in common\nTherefore we must suppose either that all Rodents including the bizcacha\nbranched off from some very ancient Marsupial which will have had a\ncharacter in some degree intermediate with respect to all existing\nMarsupials or 430 that both Rodents and Marsupials branched off from a\ncommon progenitor and that both groups have since undergone much\nmodification in divergent directions On either view we may suppose that\nthe bizcacha has retained by inheritance more of the character of its\nancient progenitor than have other Rodents and therefore it will not be\nspecially related to any one existing Marsupial but indirectly to all or\nnearly all Marsupials from having partially retained the character of\ntheir common progenitor or of an early member of the group On the other\nhand of all Marsupials as Mr Waterhouse has remarked the phascolomys\nresembles most nearly not any one species but the general order of\nRodents In this case however it may be strongly suspected that the\nresemblance is only analogical owing to the phascolomys having become\nadapted to habits like those of a Rodent The elder De Candolle has made\nnearly similar observations on the general nature of the affinities of\ndistinct orders of plants\n\nOn the principle of the multiplication and gradual divergence in character\nof the species descended from a common parent together with their\nretention by inheritance of some characters in common we can understand\nthe excessively complex and radiating affinities by which all the members\nof the same family or higher group are connected together For the common\nparent of a whole family of species now broken up by extinction into\ndistinct groups and subgroups will have transmitted some of its\ncharacters modified in various ways and degrees to all and the several\nspecies will consequently be related to each other by circuitous lines of\naffinity of various lengths as may be seen in the diagram so often\nreferred to mounting up through many predecessors As it is difficult to\nshow the bloodrelationship between the numerous kindred 431 of any\nancient and noble family even by the aid of a genealogical tree and\nalmost impossible to do this without this aid we can understand the\nextraordinary difficulty which naturalists have experienced in describing\nwithout the aid of a diagram the various affinities which they perceive\nbetween the many living and extinct members of the same great natural\nclass\n\nExtinction as we have seen in the fourth chapter has played an important\npart in defining and widening the intervals between the several groups in\neach class We may thus account even for the distinctness of whole classes\nfrom each otherfor instance of birds from all other vertebrate\nanimalsby the belief that many ancient forms of life have been utterly\nlost through which the early progenitors of birds were formerly connected\nwith the early progenitors of the other vertebrate classes There has been\nless entire extinction of the forms of life which once connected fishes\nwith batrachians There has been still less in some other classes as in\nthat of the Crustacea for here the most wonderfully diverse forms are\nstill tied together by a long but broken chain of affinities Extinction\nhas only separated groups: it has by no means made them for if every form\nwhich has ever lived on this earth were suddenly to reappear though it\nwould be quite impossible to give definitions by which each group could be\ndistinguished from other groups as all would blend together by steps as\nfine as those between the finest existing varieties nevertheless a natural\nclassification or at least a natural arrangement would be possible We\nshall see this by turning to the diagram: the letters A to L may\nrepresent eleven Silurian genera some of which have produced large groups\nof modified descendants Every intermediate link between these eleven\ngenera and their primordial parent and every 432 intermediate link in\neach branch and subbranch of their descendants may be supposed to be\nstill alive and the links to be as fine as those between the finest\nvarieties In this case it would be quite impossible to give any definition\nby which the several members of the several groups could be distinguished\nfrom their more immediate parents or these parents from their ancient and\nunknown progenitor Yet the natural arrangement in the diagram would still\nhold good and on the principle of inheritance all the forms descended\nfrom A or from I would have something in common In a tree we can specify\nthis or that branch though at the actual fork the two unite and blend\ntogether We could not as I have said define the several groups but we\ncould pick out types or forms representing most of the characters of each\ngroup whether large or small and thus give a general idea of the value of\nthe differences between them This is what we should be driven to if we\nwere ever to succeed in collecting all the forms in any class which have\nlived throughout all time and space We shall certainly never succeed in\nmaking so perfect a collection: nevertheless in certain classes we are\ntending in this direction and Milne Edwards has lately insisted in an\nable paper on the high importance of looking to types whether or not we\ncan separate and define the groups to which such types belong\n\nFinally we have seen that natural selection which results from the\nstruggle for existence and which almost inevitably induces extinction and\ndivergence of character in the many descendants from one dominant\nparentspecies explains that great and universal feature in the affinities\nof all organic beings namely their subordination in group under group We\nuse the element of descent in classing the individuals of both sexes and of\nall ages although having few characters in common 433 under one\nspecies we use descent in classing acknowledged varieties however\ndifferent they may be from their parent and I believe this element of\ndescent is the hidden bond of connexion which naturalists have sought under\nthe term of the Natural System On this idea of the natural system being\nin so far as it has been perfected genealogical in its arrangement with\nthe grades of difference between the descendants from a common parent\nexpressed by the terms genera families orders c we can understand the\nrules which we are compelled to follow in our classification We can\nunderstand why we value certain resemblances far more than others why we\nare permitted to use rudimentary and useless organs or others of trifling\nphysiological importance why in comparing one group with a distinct\ngroup we summarily reject analogical or adaptive characters and yet use\nthese same characters within the limits of the same group We can clearly\nsee how it is that all living and extinct forms can be grouped together in\none great system and how the several members of each class are connected\ntogether by the most complex and radiating lines of affinities We shall\nnever probably disentangle the inextricable web of affinities between the\nmembers of any one class but when we have a distinct object in view and\ndo not look to some unknown plan of creation we may hope to make sure but\nslow progress\n\n\n\nMorphologyWe have seen that the members of the same class\nindependently of their habits of life resemble each other in the general\nplan of their organisation This resemblance is often expressed by the term\nunity of type or by saying that the several parts and organs in the\ndifferent species of the class are homologous The whole subject is\nincluded under 434 the general name of Morphology This is the most\ninteresting department of natural history and may be said to be its very\nsoul What can be more curious than that the hand of a man formed for\ngrasping that of a mole for digging the leg of the horse the paddle of\nthe porpoise and the wing of the bat should all be constructed on the\nsame pattern and should include similar bones in the same relative\npositions Geoffroy St Hilaire has insisted strongly on the high\nimportance of relative connexion in homologous organs: the parts may change\nto almost any extent in form and size and yet they always remain connected\ntogether in the same order We never find for instance the bones of the\narm and forearm or of the thigh and leg transposed Hence the same names\ncan be given to the homologous bones in widely different animals We see\nthe same great law in the construction of the mouths of insects: what can\nbe more different than the immensely long spiral proboscis of a\nsphinxmoth the curious folded one of a bee or bug and the great jaws of\na beetleyet all these organs serving for such different purposes are\nformed by infinitely numerous modifications of an upper lip mandibles and\ntwo pairs of maxill Analogous laws govern the construction of the mouths\nand limbs of crustaceans So it is with the flowers of plants\n\nNothing can be more hopeless than to attempt to explain this similarity of\npattern in members of the same class by utility or by the doctrine of\nfinal causes The hopelessness of the attempt has been expressly admitted\nby Owen in his most interesting work on the Nature of Limbs On the\nordinary view of the independent creation of each being we can only say\nthat so it isthat it has so pleased the Creator to construct each animal\nand plant\n\nThe explanation is manifest on the theory of the 435 natural selection of\nsuccessive slight modificationseach modification being profitable in\nsome way to the modified form but often affecting by correlation of growth\nother parts of the organisation In changes of this nature there will be\nlittle or no tendency to modify the original pattern or to transpose\nparts The bones of a limb might be shortened and widened to any extent\nand become gradually enveloped in thick membrane so as to serve as a fin\nor a webbed foot might have all its bones or certain bones lengthened to\nany extent and the membrane connecting them increased to any extent so as\nto serve as a wing: yet in all this great amount of modification there will\nbe no tendency to alter the framework of bones or the relative connexion of\nthe several parts If we suppose that the ancient progenitor the archetype\nas it may be called of all mammals had its limbs constructed on the\nexisting general pattern for whatever purpose they served we can at once\nperceive the plain signification of the homologous construction of the\nlimbs throughout the whole class So with the mouths of insects we have\nonly to suppose that their common progenitor had an upper lip mandibles\nand two pair of maxill these parts being perhaps very simple in form and\nthen natural selection acting on some originally created form will\naccount for the infinite diversity in structure and function of the mouths\nof insects Nevertheless it is conceivable that the general pattern of an\norgan might become so much obscured as to be finally lost by the atrophy\nand ultimately by the complete abortion of certain parts by the soldering\ntogether of other parts and by the doubling or multiplication of\nothersvariations which we know to be within the limits of possibility\nIn the paddles of the extinct gigantic sealizards and in the mouths of\ncertain suctorial crustaceans the 436 general pattern seems to have been\nthus to a certain extent obscured\n\nThere is another and equally curious branch of the present subject namely\nthe comparison not of the same part in different members of a class but of\nthe different parts or organs in the same individual Most physiologists\nbelieve that the bones of the skull are homologous withthat is correspond\nin number and in relative connexion withthe elemental parts of a certain\nnumber of vertebr The anterior and posterior limbs in each member of the\nvertebrate and articulate classes are plainly homologous We see the same\nlaw in comparing the wonderfully complex jaws and legs in crustaceans It\nis familiar to almost every one that in a flower the relative position of\nthe sepals petals stamens and pistils as well as their intimate\nstructure are intelligible on the view that they consist of metamorphosed\nleaves arranged in a spire In monstrous plants we often get direct\nevidence of the possibility of one organ being transformed into another\nand we can actually see in embryonic crustaceans and in many other animals\nand in flowers that organs which when mature become extremely different\nare at an early stage of growth exactly alike\n\nHow inexplicable are these facts on the ordinary view of creation Why\nshould the brain be enclosed in a box composed of such numerous and such\nextraordinary shaped pieces of bone As Owen has remarked the benefit\nderived from the yielding of the separate pieces in the act of parturition\nof mammals will by no means explain the same construction in the skulls of\nbirds Why should similar bones have been created in the formation of the\nwing and leg of a bat used as they are for such totally different\npurposes Why should one crustacean which has an extremely complex 437\nmouth formed of many parts consequently always have fewer legs or\nconversely those with many legs have simpler mouths Why should the\nsepals petals stamens and pistils in any individual flower though\nfitted for such widely different purposes be all constructed on the same\npattern\n\nOn the theory of natural selection we can satisfactorily answer these\nquestions In the vertebrata we see a series of internal vertebr bearing\ncertain processes and appendages in the articulata we see the body\ndivided into a series of segments bearing external appendages and in\nflowering plants we see a series of successive spiral whorls of leaves An\nindefinite repetition of the same part or organ is the common\ncharacteristic as Owen has observed of all low or littlemodified forms\ntherefore we may readily believe that the unknown progenitor of the\nvertebrata possessed many vertebr the unknown progenitor of the\narticulata many segments and the unknown progenitor of flowering plants\nmany spiral whorls of leaves We have formerly seen that parts many times\nrepeated are eminently liable to vary in number and structure consequently\nit is quite probable that natural selection during a longcontinued course\nof modification should have seized on a certain number of the primordially\nsimilar elements many times repeated and have adapted them to the most\ndiverse purposes And as the whole amount of modification will have been\neffected by slight successive steps we need not wonder at discovering in\nsuch parts or organs a certain degree of fundamental resemblance retained\nby the strong principle of inheritance\n\nIn the great class of molluscs though we can homologise the parts of one\nspecies with those of other and distinct species we can indicate but few\nserial homologies that is we are seldom enabled to say that one 438\npart or organ is homologous with another in the same individual And we can\nunderstand this fact for in molluscs even in the lowest members of the\nclass we do not find nearly so much indefinite repetition of any one part\nas we find in the other great classes of the animal and vegetable kingdoms\n\nNaturalists frequently speak of the skull as formed of metamorphosed\nvertebr: the jaws of crabs as metamorphosed legs the stamens and pistils\nof flowers as metamorphosed leaves but it would in these cases probably be\nmore correct as Professor Huxley has remarked to speak of both skull and\nvertebr both jaws and legs cas having been metamorphosed not one\nfrom the other but from some common element Naturalists however use\nsuch language only in a metaphorical sense: they are far from meaning that\nduring a long course of descent primordial organs of any kindvertebr in\nthe one case and legs in the otherhave actually been modified into skulls\nor jaws Yet so strong is the appearance of a modification of this nature\nhaving occurred that naturalists can hardly avoid employing language\nhaving this plain signification On my view these terms may be used\nliterally and the wonderful fact of the jaws for instance of a crab\nretaining numerous characters which they would probably have retained\nthrough inheritance if they had really been metamorphosed during a long\ncourse of descent from true legs or from some simple appendage is\nexplained\n\n\n\nEmbryologyIt has already been casually remarked that certain organs in\nthe individual which when mature become widely different and serve for\ndifferent purposes are in the embryo exactly alike The embryos also of\ndistinct animals within the same class are often strikingly similar: a\nbetter proof of this cannot be given than a 439 circumstance mentioned\nby Agassiz namely that having forgotten to ticket the embryo of some\nvertebrate animal he cannot now tell whether it be that of a mammal bird\nor reptile The vermiform larv of moths flies beetles c resemble\neach other much more closely than do the mature insects but in the case of\nlarv the embryos are active and have been adapted for special lines of\nlife A trace of the law of embryonic resemblance sometimes lasts till a\nrather late age: thus birds of the same genus and of closely allied\ngenera often resemble each other in their first and second plumage as we\nsee in the spotted feathers in the thrush group In the cat tribe most of\nthe species are striped or spotted in lines and stripes can be plainly\ndistinguished in the whelp of the lion We occasionally though rarely see\nsomething of this kind in plants: thus the embryonic leaves of the ulex or\nfurze and the first leaves of the phyllodineous acaceas are pinnate or\ndivided like the ordinary leaves of the leguminos\n\nThe points of structure in which the embryos of widely different animals\nof the same class resemble each other often have no direct relation to\ntheir conditions of existence We cannot for instance suppose that in the\nembryos of the vertebrata the peculiar looplike course of the arteries\nnear the branchial slits are related to similar conditionsin the young\nmammal which is nourished in the womb of its mother in the egg of the bird\nwhich is hatched in a nest and in the spawn of a frog under water We have\nno more reason to believe in such a relation than we have to believe that\nthe same bones in the hand of a man wing of a bat and fin of a porpoise\nare related to similar conditions of life No one will suppose that the\nstripes on the whelp of a lion or the spots on the young blackbird 440\nare of any use to these animals or are related to the conditions to which\nthey are exposed\n\nThe case however is different when an animal during any part of its\nembryonic career is active and has to provide for itself The period of\nactivity may come on earlier or later in life but whenever it comes on\nthe adaptation of the larva to its conditions of life is just as perfect\nand as beautiful as in the adult animal From such special adaptations the\nsimilarity of the larv or active embryos of allied animals is sometimes\nmuch obscured and cases could be given of the larv of two species or of\ntwo groups of species differing quite as much or even more from each\nother than do their adult parents In most cases however the larv\nthough active still obey more or less closely the law of common\nembryonic resemblance Cirripedes afford a good instance of this: even the\nillustrious Cuvier did not perceive that a barnacle was as it certainly\nis a crustacean but a glance at the larva shows this to be the case in an\nunmistakeable manner So again the two main divisions of cirripedes the\npedunculated and sessile which differ widely in external appearance have\nlarv in all their stages barely distinguishable\n\nThe embryo in the course of development generally rises in organisation: I\nuse this expression though I am aware that it is hardly possible to define\nclearly what is meant by the organisation being higher or lower But no one\nprobably will dispute that the butterfly is higher than the caterpillar In\nsome cases however the mature animal is generally considered as lower in\nthe scale than the larva as with certain parasitic crustaceans To refer\nonce again to cirripedes: the larv in the first stage have three pairs of\nlegs a very simple single eye and a probosciformed mouth with which they\nfeed largely for they increase much in 441 size In the second stage\nanswering to the chrysalis stage of butterflies they have six pairs of\nbeautifully constructed natatory legs a pair of magnificent compound eyes\nand extremely complex antenn but they have a closed and imperfect mouth\nand cannot feed: their function at this stage is to search by their\nwelldeveloped organs of sense and to reach by their active powers of\nswimming a proper place on which to become attached and to undergo their\nfinal metamorphosis When this is completed they are fixed for life: their\nlegs are now converted into prehensile organs they again obtain a\nwellconstructed mouth but they have no antenn and their two eyes are\nnow reconverted into a minute single and very simple eyespot In this\nlast and complete state cirripedes may be considered as either more highly\nor more lowly organised than they were in the larval condition But in some\ngenera the larv become developed either into hermaphrodites having the\nordinary structure or into what I have called complemental males: and in\nthe latter the development has assuredly been retrograde for the male is\na mere sack which lives for a short time and is destitute of mouth\nstomach or other organ of importance excepting for reproduction\n\nWe are so much accustomed to see differences in structure between the\nembryo and the adult and likewise a close similarity in the embryos of\nwidely different animals within the same class that we might be led to\nlook at these facts as necessarily contingent in some manner on growth But\nthere is no obvious reason why for instance the wing of a bat or the fin\nof a porpoise should not have been sketched out with all the parts in\nproper proportion as soon as any structure became visible in the embryo\nAnd in some whole groups of animals and in certain members of other groups\nthe embryo does not at any period differ widely from the 442 adult: thus\nOwen has remarked in regard to cuttlefish there is no metamorphosis the\ncephalopodic character is manifested long before the parts of the embryo\nare completed and again in spiders there is nothing worthy to be called\na metamorphosis The larv of insects whether adapted to the most diverse\nand active habits or quite inactive being fed by their parents or placed\nin the midst of proper nutriment yet nearly all pass through a similar\nwormlike stage of development but in some few cases as in that of Aphis\nif we look to the admirable drawings by Professor Huxley of the development\nof this insect we see no trace of the vermiform stage\n\nHow then can we explain these several facts in embryologynamely the\nvery general but not universal difference in structure between the embryo\nand the adultof parts in the same individual embryo which ultimately\nbecome very unlike and serve for diverse purposes being at this early\nperiod of growth alikeof embryos of different species within the same\nclass generally but not universally resembling each otherof the\nstructure of the embryo not being closely related to its conditions of\nexistence except when the embryo becomes at any period of life active and\nhas to provide for itselfof the embryo apparently having sometimes a\nhigher organisation than the mature animal into which it is developed I\nbelieve that all these facts can be explained as follows on the view of\ndescent with modification\n\nIt is commonly assumed perhaps from monstrosities often affecting the\nembryos at a very early period that slight variations necessarily appear\nat an equally early period But we have little evidence on this\nheadindeed the evidence rather points the other way for it is notorious\nthat breeders of cattle horses and various 443 fancy animals cannot\npositively tell until some time after the animal has been born what its\nmerits or form will ultimately turn out We see this plainly in our own\nchildren we cannot always tell whether the child will be tall or short or\nwhat its precise features will be The question is not at what period of\nlife any variation has been caused but at what period it is fully\ndisplayed The cause may have acted and I believe generally has acted\neven before the embryo is formed and the variation may be due to the male\nand female sexual elements having been affected by the conditions to which\neither parent or their ancestors have been exposed Nevertheless an\neffect thus caused at a very early period even before the formation of the\nembryo may appear late in life as when an hereditary disease which\nappears in old age alone has been communicated to the offspring from the\nreproductive element of one parent Or again as when the horns of\ncrossbred cattle have been affected by the shape of the horns of either\nparent For the welfare of a very young animal as long as it remains in\nits mothers womb or in the egg or as long as it is nourished and\nprotected by its parent it must be quite unimportant whether most of its\ncharacters are fully acquired a little earlier or later in life It would\nnot signify for instance to a bird which obtained its food best by having\na long beak whether or not it assumed a beak of this particular length as\nlong as it was fed by its parents Hence I conclude that it is quite\npossible that each of the many successive modifications by which each\nspecies has acquired its present structure may have supervened at a not\nvery early period of life and some direct evidence from our domestic\nanimals supports this view But in other cases it is quite possible that\neach successive modification or 444 most of them may have appeared at\nan extremely early period\n\nI have stated in the first chapter that there is some evidence to render\nit probable that at whatever age any variation first appears in the\nparent it tends to reappear at a corresponding age in the offspring\nCertain variations can only appear at corresponding ages for instance\npeculiarities in the caterpillar cocoon or imago states of the silkmoth\nor again in the horns of almost fullgrown cattle But further than this\nvariations which for all that we can see might have appeared earlier or\nlater in life tend to appear at a corresponding age in the offspring and\nparent I am far from meaning that this is invariably the case and I could\ngive a good many cases of variations taking the word in the largest sense\nwhich have supervened at an earlier age in the child than in the parent\n\nThese two principles if their truth be admitted will I believe explain\nall the above specified leading facts in embryology But first let us look\nat a few analogous cases in domestic varieties Some authors who have\nwritten on Dogs maintain that the greyhound and bulldog though appearing\nso different are really varieties most closely allied and have probably\ndescended from the same wild stock hence I was curious to see how far\ntheir puppies differed from each other: I was told by breeders that they\ndiffered just as much as their parents and this judging by the eye\nseemed almost to be the case but on actually measuring the old dogs and\ntheir sixdays old puppies I found that the puppies had not nearly\nacquired their full amount of proportional difference So again I was\ntold that the foals of cart and racehorses differed as much as the\nfullgrown animals and this surprised me greatly as I think it probable\nthat the difference between these two breeds has been wholly 445 caused\nby selection under domestication but having had careful measurements made\nof the dam and of a threedays old colt of a race and heavy carthorse I\nfind that the colts have by no means acquired their full amount of\nproportional difference\n\nAs the evidence appears to me conclusive that the several domestic breeds\nof Pigeon have descended from one wild species I compared young pigeons of\nvarious breeds within twelve hours after being hatched I carefully\nmeasured the proportions but will not here give details of the beak\nwidth of mouth length of nostril and of eyelid size of feet and length of\nleg in the wild stock in pouters fantails runts barbs dragons\ncarriers and tumblers Now some of these birds when mature differ so\nextraordinarily in length and form of beak that they would I cannot\ndoubt be ranked in distinct genera had they been natural productions But\nwhen the nestling birds of these several breeds were placed in a row\nthough most of them could be distinguished from each other yet their\nproportional differences in the above specified several points were\nincomparably less than in the fullgrown birds Some characteristic points\nof differencefor instance that of the width of mouthcould hardly be\ndetected in the young But there was one remarkable exception to this rule\nfor the young of the shortfaced tumbler differed from the young of the\nwild rockpigeon and of the other breeds in all its proportions almost\nexactly as much as in the adult state\n\nThe two principles above given seem to me to explain these facts in regard\nto the later embryonic stages of our domestic varieties Fanciers select\ntheir horses dogs and pigeons for breeding when they are nearly grown\nup: they are indifferent whether the desired qualities and structures have\nbeen acquired earlier or 446 later in life if the fullgrown animal\npossesses them And the cases just given more especially that of pigeons\nseem to show that the characteristic differences which give value to each\nbreed and which have been accumulated by mans selection have not\ngenerally first appeared at an early period of life and have been\ninherited by the offspring at a corresponding not early period But the\ncase of the shortfaced tumbler which when twelve hours old had acquired\nits proper proportions proves that this is not the universal rule for\nhere the characteristic differences must either have appeared at an earlier\nperiod than usual or if not so the differences must have been inherited\nnot at the corresponding but at an earlier age\n\nNow let us apply these facts and the above two principleswhich latter\nthough not proved true can be shown to be in some degree probableto\nspecies in a state of nature Let us take a genus of birds descended on my\ntheory from some one parentspecies and of which the several new species\nhave become modified through natural selection in accordance with their\ndiverse habits Then from the many slight successive steps of variation\nhaving supervened at a rather late age and having been inherited at a\ncorresponding age the young of the new species of our supposed genus will\nmanifestly tend to resemble each other much more closely than do the\nadults just as we have seen in the case of pigeons We may extend this\nview to whole families or even classes The forelimbs for instance which\nserved as legs in the parentspecies may have become by a long course of\nmodification adapted in one descendant to act as hands in another as\npaddles in another as wings and on the above two principlesnamely of\neach successive modification supervening at a rather late age and being\ninherited at a 447 corresponding late agethe forelimbs in the embryos\nof the several descendants of the parentspecies will still resemble each\nother closely for they will not have been modified But in each of our new\nspecies the embryonic forelimbs will differ greatly from the forelimbs\nin the mature animal the limbs in the latter having undergone much\nmodification at a rather late period of life and having thus been\nconverted into hands or paddles or wings Whatever influence\nlongcontinued exercise or use on the one hand and disuse on the other\nmay have in modifying an organ such influence will mainly affect the\nmature animal which has come to its full powers of activity and has to\ngain its own living and the effects thus produced will be inherited at a\ncorresponding mature age Whereas the young will remain unmodified or be\nmodified in a lesser degree by the effects of use and disuse\n\nIn certain cases the successive steps of variation might supervene from\ncauses of which we are wholly ignorant at a very early period of life or\neach step might be inherited at an earlier period than that at which it\nfirst appeared In either case as with the shortfaced tumbler the young\nor embryo would closely resemble the mature parentform We have seen that\nthis is the rule of development in certain whole groups of animals as with\ncuttlefish and spiders and with a few members of the great class of\ninsects as with Aphis With respect to the final cause of the young in\nthese cases not undergoing any metamorphosis or closely resembling their\nparents from their earliest age we can see that this would result from the\ntwo following contingencies: firstly from the young during a course of\nmodification carried on for many generations having to provide for their\nown wants at a very early stage 448 of development and secondly from\ntheir following exactly the same habits of life with their parents for in\nthis case it would be indispensable for the existence of the species that\nthe child should be modified at a very early age in the same manner with\nits parents in accordance with their similar habits Some further\nexplanation however of the embryo not undergoing any metamorphosis is\nperhaps requisite If on the other hand it profited the young to follow\nhabits of life in any degree different from those of their parent and\nconsequently to be constructed in a slightly different manner then on the\nprinciple of inheritance at corresponding ages the active young or larv\nmight easily be rendered by natural selection different to any conceivable\nextent from their parents Such differences might also become correlated\nwith successive stages of development so that the larv in the first\nstage might differ greatly from the larv in the second stage as we have\nseen to be the case with cirripedes The adult might become fitted for\nsites or habits in which organs of locomotion or of the senses c would\nbe useless and in this case the final metamorphosis would be said to be\nretrograde\n\nAs all the organic beings extinct and recent which have ever lived on\nthis earth have to be classed together and as all have been connected by\nthe finest gradations the best or indeed if our collections were nearly\nperfect the only possible arrangement would be genealogical Descent\nbeing on my view the hidden bond of connexion which naturalists have been\nseeking under the term of the natural system On this view we can\nunderstand how it is that in the eyes of most naturalists the structure\nof the embryo is even more important for classification than that of the\nadult For the embryo is the animal in its less modified state 449 and\nin so far it reveals the structure of its progenitor In two groups of\nanimals however much they may at present differ from each other in\nstructure and habits if they pass through the same or similar embryonic\nstages we may feel assured that they have both descended from the same or\nnearly similar parents and are therefore in that degree closely related\nThus community in embryonic structure reveals community of descent It\nwill reveal this community of descent however much the structure of the\nadult may have been modified and obscured we have seen for instance that\ncirripedes can at once be recognised by their larv as belonging to the\ngreat class of crustaceans As the embryonic state of each species and\ngroup of species partially shows us the structure of their less modified\nancient progenitors we can clearly see why ancient and extinct forms of\nlife should resemble the embryos of their descendantsour existing\nspecies Agassiz believes this to be a law of nature but I am bound to\nconfess that I only hope to see the law hereafter proved true It can be\nproved true in those cases alone in which the ancient state now supposed\nto be represented in existing embryos has not been obliterated either by\nthe successive variations in a long course of modification having\nsupervened at a very early age or by the variations having been inherited\nat an earlier period than that at which they first appeared It should also\nbe borne in mind that the supposed law of resemblance of ancient forms of\nlife to the embryonic stages of recent forms may be true but yet owing\nto the geological record not extending far enough back in time may remain\nfor a long period or for ever incapable of demonstration\n\nThus as it seems to me the leading facts in embryology which are second\nin importance to none in natural history are explained on the principle of\nslight 450 modifications not appearing in the many descendants from some\none ancient progenitor at a very early period in the life of each though\nperhaps caused at the earliest and being inherited at a corresponding not\nearly period Embryology rises greatly in interest when we thus look at\nthe embryo as a picture more or less obscured of the common parentform\nof each great class of animals\n\n\n\nRudimentary atrophied or aborted OrgansOrgans or parts in this\nstrange condition bearing the stamp of inutility are extremely common\nthroughout nature For instance rudimentary mamm are very general in the\nmales of mammals: I presume that the bastardwing in birds may be safely\nconsidered as a digit in a rudimentary state: in very many snakes one lobe\nof the lungs is rudimentary in other snakes there are rudiments of the\npelvis and hind limbs Some of the cases of rudimentary organs are\nextremely curious for instance the presence of teeth in foetal whales\nwhich when grown up have not a tooth in their heads and the presence of\nteeth which never cut through the gums in the upper jaws of our unborn\ncalves It has even been stated on good authority that rudiments of teeth\ncan be detected in the beaks of certain embryonic birds Nothing can be\nplainer than that wings are formed for flight yet in how many insects do\nwe see wings so reduced in size as to be utterly incapable of flight and\nnot rarely lying under wingcases firmly soldered together\n\nThe meaning of rudimentary organs is often quite unmistakeable: for\ninstance there are beetles of the same genus and even of the same species\nresembling each other most closely in all respects one of which will have\nfullsized wings and another mere rudiments of membrane and here it is\nimpossible to doubt that the 451 rudiments represent wings Rudimentary\norgans sometimes retain their potentiality and are merely not developed:\nthis seems to be the case with the mamm of male mammals for many\ninstances are on record of these organs having become well developed in\nfullgrown males and having secreted milk So again there are normally\nfour developed and two rudimentary teats in the udders of the genus Bos\nbut in our domestic cows the two sometimes become developed and give milk\nIn plants of the same species the petals sometimes occur as mere rudiments\nand sometimes in a welldeveloped state In plants with separated sexes\nthe male flowers often have a rudiment of a pistil and Klreuter found\nthat by crossing such male plants with an hermaphrodite species the\nrudiment of the pistil in the hybrid offspring was much increased in size\nand this shows that the rudiment and the perfect pistil are essentially\nalike in nature\n\nAn organ serving for two purposes may become rudimentary or utterly\naborted for one even the more important purpose and remain perfectly\nefficient for the other Thus in plants the office of the pistil is to\nallow the pollentubes to reach the ovules protected in the ovarium at its\nbase The pistil consists of a stigma supported on the style but in some\nComposit the male florets which of course cannot be fecundated have a\npistil which is in a rudimentary state for it is not crowned with a\nstigma but the style remains well developed and is clothed with hairs as\nin other composit for the purpose of brushing the pollen out of the\nsurrounding anthers Again an organ may become rudimentary for its proper\npurpose and be used for a distinct object: in certain fish the\nswimbladder seems to be nearly rudimentary for its proper function of\ngiving buoyancy but has become converted into a 452 nascent breathing\norgan or lung Other similar instances could be given\n\nOrgans however little developed if of use should not be called\nrudimentary they cannot properly be said to be in an atrophied condition\nthey may be called nascent and may hereafter be developed to any extent by\nnatural selection Rudimentary organs on the other hand are essentially\nuseless as teeth which never cut through the gums in a still less\ndeveloped condition they would be of still less use They cannot\ntherefore under their present condition have been formed by natural\nselection which acts solely by the preservation of useful modifications\nthey have been retained as we shall see by inheritance and relate to a\nformer condition of their possessor It is difficult to know what are\nnascent organs looking to the future we cannot of course tell how any\npart will be developed and whether it is now nascent looking to the past\ncreatures with an organ in a nascent condition will generally have been\nsupplanted and exterminated by their successors with the organ in a more\nperfect and developed condition The wing of the penguin is of high\nservice and acts as a fin it may therefore represent the nascent state\nof the wings of birds not that I believe this to be the case it is more\nprobably a reduced organ modified for a new function: the wing of the\nApteryx is useless and is truly rudimentary The mammary glands of the\nOrnithorhynchus may perhaps be considered in comparison with the udder\nof a cow as in a nascent state The ovigerous frena of certain cirripedes\nwhich are only slightly developed and which have ceased to give attachment\nto the ova are nascent branchi\n\nRudimentary organs in the individuals of the same species are very liable\nto vary in degree of development 453 and in other respects Moreover in\nclosely allied species the degree to which the same organ has been\nrendered rudimentary occasionally differs much This latter fact is well\nexemplified in the state of the wings of the female moths in certain\ngroups Rudimentary organs may be utterly aborted and this implies that\nwe find in an animal or plant no trace of an organ which analogy would\nlead us to expect to find and which is occasionally found in monstrous\nindividuals of the species Thus in the snapdragon antirrhinum we\ngenerally do not find a rudiment of a fifth stamen but this may sometimes\nbe seen In tracing the homologies of the same part in different members of\na class nothing is more common or more necessary than the use and\ndiscovery of rudiments This is well shown in the drawings given by Owen of\nthe bones of the leg of the horse ox and rhinoceros\n\nIt is an important fact that rudimentary organs such as teeth in the upper\njaws of whales and ruminants can often be detected in the embryo but\nafterwards wholly disappear It is also I believe a universal rule that\na rudimentary part or organ is of greater size relatively to the adjoining\nparts in the embryo than in the adult so that the organ at this early age\nis less rudimentary or even cannot be said to be in any degree\nrudimentary Hence also a rudimentary organ in the adult is often said to\nhave retained its embryonic condition\n\nI have now given the leading facts with respect to rudimentary organs In\nreflecting on them every one must be struck with astonishment: for the\nsame reasoning power which tells us plainly that most parts and organs are\nexquisitely adapted for certain purposes tells us with equal plainness\nthat these rudimentary or atrophied organs are imperfect and useless In\nworks 454 on natural history rudimentary organs are generally said to\nhave been created for the sake of symmetry or in order to complete the\nscheme of nature but this seems to me no explanation merely a\nrestatement of the fact Would it be thought sufficient to say that\nbecause planets revolve in elliptic courses round the sun satellites\nfollow the same course round the planets for the sake of symmetry and to\ncomplete the scheme of nature An eminent physiologist accounts for the\npresence of rudimentary organs by supposing that they serve to excrete\nmatter in excess or injurious to the system but can we suppose that the\nminute papilla which often represents the pistil in male flowers and\nwhich is formed merely of cellular tissue can thus act Can we suppose\nthat the formation of rudimentary teeth which are subsequently absorbed\ncan be of any service to the rapidly growing embryonic calf by the\nexcretion of precious phosphate of lime When a mans fingers have been\namputated imperfect nails sometimes appear on the stumps: I could as soon\nbelieve that these vestiges of nails have appeared not from unknown laws\nof growth but in order to excrete horny matter as that the rudimentary\nnails on the fin of the manatee were formed for this purpose\n\nOn my view of descent with modification the origin of rudimentary organs\nis simple We have plenty of cases of rudimentary organs in our domestic\nproductionsas the stump of a tail in tailless breedsthe vestige of an\near in earless breedsthe reappearance of minute dangling horns in\nhornless breeds of cattle more especially according to Youatt in young\nanimalsand the state of the whole flower in the cauliflower We often\nsee rudiments of various parts in monsters But I doubt whether any of\nthese cases throw light on the origin of rudimentary organs in a state of\nnature 455 further than by showing that rudiments can be produced for I\ndoubt whether species under nature ever undergo abrupt changes I believe\nthat disuse has been the main agency that it has led in successive\ngenerations to the gradual reduction of various organs until they have\nbecome rudimentaryas in the case of the eyes of animals inhabiting dark\ncaverns and of the wings of birds inhabiting oceanic islands which have\nseldom been forced to take flight and have ultimately lost the power of\nflying Again an organ useful under certain conditions might become\ninjurious under others as with the wings of beetles living on small and\nexposed islands and in this case natural selection would continue slowly\nto reduce the organ until it was rendered harmless and rudimentary\n\nAny change in function which can be effected by insensibly small steps is\nwithin the power of natural selection so that an organ rendered during\nchanged habits of life useless or injurious for one purpose might be\nmodified and used for another purpose Or an organ might be retained for\none alone of its former functions An organ when rendered useless may\nwell be variable for its variations cannot be checked by natural\nselection At whatever period of life disuse or selection reduces an organ\nand this will generally be when the being has come to maturity and to its\nfull powers of action the principle of inheritance at corresponding ages\nwill reproduce the organ in its reduced state at the same age and\nconsequently will seldom affect or reduce it in the embryo Thus we can\nunderstand the greater relative size of rudimentary organs in the embryo\nand their lesser relative size in the adult But if each step of the\nprocess of reduction were to be inherited not at the corresponding age\nbut at an extremely early period of life as we have good 456 reason to\nbelieve to be possible the rudimentary part would tend to be wholly lost\nand we should have a case of complete abortion The principle also of\neconomy explained in a former chapter by which the materials forming any\npart or structure if not useful to the possessor will be saved as far as\nis possible will probably often come into play and this will tend to\ncause the entire obliteration of a rudimentary organ\n\nAs the presence of rudimentary organs is thus due to the tendency in every\npart of the organisation which has long existed to be inheritedwe can\nunderstand on the genealogical view of classification how it is that\nsystematists have found rudimentary parts as useful as or even sometimes\nmore useful than parts of high physiological importance Rudimentary\norgans may be compared with the letters in a word still retained in the\nspelling but become useless in the pronunciation but which serve as a\nclue in seeking for its derivation On the view of descent with\nmodification we may conclude that the existence of organs in a\nrudimentary imperfect and useless condition or quite aborted far from\npresenting a strange difficulty as they assuredly do on the ordinary\ndoctrine of creation might even have been anticipated and can be\naccounted for by the laws of inheritance\n\n\n\nSummaryIn this chapter I have attempted to show that the\nsubordination of group to group in all organisms throughout all time that\nthe nature of the relationship by which all living and extinct beings are\nunited by complex radiating and circuitous lines of affinities into one\ngrand system the rules followed and the difficulties encountered by\nnaturalists in their classifications the value set upon characters if\nconstant and prevalent whether of high vital importance or of the most\ntrifling 457 importance or as in rudimentary organs of no importance\nthe wide opposition in value between analogical or adaptive characters and\ncharacters of true affinity and other such rulesall naturally follow on\nthe view of the common parentage of those forms which are considered by\nnaturalists as allied together with their modification through natural\nselection with its contingencies of extinction and divergence of\ncharacter In considering this view of classification it should be borne\nin mind that the element of descent has been universally used in ranking\ntogether the sexes ages and acknowledged varieties of the same species\nhowever different they may be in structure If we extend the use of this\nelement of descentthe only certainly known cause of similarity in\norganic beingswe shall understand what is meant by the natural system:\nit is genealogical in its attempted arrangement with the grades of\nacquired difference marked by the terms varieties species genera\nfamilies orders and classes\n\nOn this same view of descent with modification all the great facts in\nMorphology become intelligiblewhether we look to the same pattern\ndisplayed in the homologous organs to whatever purpose applied of the\ndifferent species of a class or to the homologous parts constructed on the\nsame pattern in each individual animal and plant\n\nOn the principle of successive slight variations not necessarily or\ngenerally supervening at a very early period of life and being inherited\nat a corresponding period we can understand the great leading facts in\nEmbryology namely the resemblance in an individual embryo of the\nhomologous parts which when matured will become widely different from each\nother in structure and function and the resemblance in different species\nof a class of the homologous parts or 458 organs though fitted in the\nadult members for purposes as different as possible Larv are active\nembryos which have become specially modified in relation to their habits\nof life through the principle of modifications being inherited at\ncorresponding ages On this same principleand bearing in mind that when\norgans are reduced in size either from disuse or selection it will\ngenerally be at that period of life when the being has to provide for its\nown wants and bearing in mind how strong is the principle of\ninheritancethe occurrence of rudimentary organs and their final abortion\npresent to us no inexplicable difficulties on the contrary their presence\nmight have been even anticipated The importance of embryological\ncharacters and of rudimentary organs in classification is intelligible on\nthe view that an arrangement is only so far natural as it is genealogical\n\nFinally the several classes of facts which have been considered in this\nchapter seem to me to proclaim so plainly that the innumerable species\ngenera and families of organic beings with which this world is peopled\nhave all descended each within its own class or group from common\nparents and have all been modified in the course of descent that I should\nwithout hesitation adopt this view even if it were unsupported by other\nfacts or arguments\n\n                                   \n\n\n459\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nRECAPITULATION AND CONCLUSION\n\n    Recapitulation of the difficulties on the theory of Natural\n    SelectionRecapitulation of the general and special circumstances in\n    its favourCauses of the general belief in the immutability of\n    speciesHow far the theory of natural selection may be\n    extendedEffects of its adoption on the study of Natural\n    historyConcluding remarks\n\nAs this whole volume is one long argument it may be convenient to the\nreader to have the leading facts and inferences briefly recapitulated\n\nThat many and serious objections may be advanced against the theory of\ndescent with modification through natural selection I do not deny I have\nendeavoured to give to them their full force Nothing at first can appear\nmore difficult to believe than that the more complex organs and instincts\nshould have been perfected not by means superior to though analogous\nwith human reason but by the accumulation of innumerable slight\nvariations each good for the individual possessor Nevertheless this\ndifficulty though appearing to our imagination insuperably great cannot\nbe considered real if we admit the following propositions namelythat\ngradations in the perfection of any organ or instinct which we may\nconsider either do now exist or could have existed each good of its\nkindthat all organs and instincts are in ever so slight a degree\nvariableand lastly that there is a struggle for existence leading to\nthe preservation of each profitable deviation of structure or instinct The\ntruth of these propositions cannot I think be disputed 460\n\nIt is no doubt extremely difficult even to conjecture by what gradations\nmany structures have been perfected more especially amongst broken and\nfailing groups of organic beings but we see so many strange gradations in\nnature that we ought to be extremely cautious in saying that any organ or\ninstinct or any whole being could not have arrived at its present state\nby many graduated steps There are it must be admitted cases of special\ndifficulty on the theory of natural selection and one of the most curious\nof these is the existence of two or three defined castes of workers or\nsterile females in the same community of ants but I have attempted to show\nhow this difficulty can be mastered\n\nWith respect to the almost universal sterility of species when first\ncrossed which forms so remarkable a contrast with the almost universal\nfertility of varieties when crossed I must refer the reader to the\nrecapitulation of the facts given at the end of the eighth chapter which\nseem to me conclusively to show that this sterility is no more a special\nendowment than is the incapacity of two trees to be grafted together but\nthat it is incidental on constitutional differences in the reproductive\nsystems of the intercrossed species We see the truth of this conclusion in\nthe vast difference in the result when the same two species are crossed\nreciprocally that is when one species is first used as the father and\nthen as the mother\n\nThe fertility of varieties when intercrossed and of their mongrel offspring\ncannot be considered as universal nor is their very general fertility\nsurprising when we remember that it is not likely that either their\nconstitutions or their reproductive systems should have been profoundly\nmodified Moreover most of the varieties which have been experimentised on\nhave been 461 produced under domestication and as domestication I do\nnot mean mere confinement apparently tends to eliminate sterility we\nought not to expect it also to produce sterility\n\nThe sterility of hybrids is a very different case from that of first\ncrosses for their reproductive organs are more or less functionally\nimpotent whereas in first crosses the organs on both sides are in a\nperfect condition As we continually see that organisms of all kinds are\nrendered in some degree sterile from their constitutions having been\ndisturbed by slightly different and new conditions of life we need not\nfeel surprise at hybrids being in some degree sterile for their\nconstitutions can hardly fail to have been disturbed from being compounded\nof two distinct organisations This parallelism is supported by another\nparallel but directly opposite class of facts namely that the vigour\nand fertility of all organic beings are increased by slight changes in\ntheir conditions of life and that the offspring of slightly modified forms\nor varieties acquire from being crossed increased vigour and fertility So\nthat on the one hand considerable changes in the conditions of life and\ncrosses between greatly modified forms lessen fertility and on the other\nhand lesser changes in the conditions of life and crosses between less\nmodified forms increase fertility\n\nTurning to geographical distribution the difficulties encountered on the\ntheory of descent with modification are grave enough All the individuals\nof the same species and all the species of the same genus or even higher\ngroup must have descended from common parents and therefore in however\ndistant and isolated parts of the world they are now found they must in\nthe course of successive generations have passed from some one part to the\nothers We are often wholly unable 462 even to conjecture how this could\nhave been effected Yet as we have reason to believe that some species\nhave retained the same specific form for very long periods enormously long\nas measured by years too much stress ought not to be laid on the\noccasional wide diffusion of the same species for during very long periods\nof time there will always have been a good chance for wide migration by\nmany means A broken or interrupted range may often be accounted for by the\nextinction of the species in the intermediate regions It cannot be denied\nthat we are as yet very ignorant of the full extent of the various climatal\nand geographical changes which have affected the earth during modern\nperiods and such changes will obviously have greatly facilitated\nmigration As an example I have attempted to show how potent has been the\ninfluence of the Glacial period on the distribution both of the same and of\nrepresentative species throughout the world We are as yet profoundly\nignorant of the many occasional means of transport With respect to\ndistinct species of the same genus inhabiting very distant and isolated\nregions as the process of modification has necessarily been slow all the\nmeans of migration will have been possible during a very long period and\nconsequently the difficulty of the wide diffusion of species of the same\ngenus is in some degree lessened\n\nAs on the theory of natural selection an interminable number of\nintermediate forms must have existed linking together all the species in\neach group by gradations as fine as our present varieties it may be asked\nWhy do we not see these linking forms all around us Why are not all\norganic beings blended together in an inextricable chaos With respect to\nexisting forms we should remember that we have no right to expect\nexcepting in rare cases to discover directly connecting 463 links\nbetween them but only between each and some extinct and supplanted form\nEven on a wide area which has during a long period remained continuous\nand of which the climate and other conditions of life change insensibly in\ngoing from a district occupied by one species into another district\noccupied by a closely allied species we have no just right to expect often\nto find intermediate varieties in the intermediate zone For we have reason\nto believe that only a few species are undergoing change at any one period\nand all changes are slowly effected I have also shown that the\nintermediate varieties which will at first probably exist in the\nintermediate zones will be liable to be supplanted by the allied forms on\neither hand and the latter from existing in greater numbers will\ngenerally be modified and improved at a quicker rate than the intermediate\nvarieties which exist in lesser numbers so that the intermediate\nvarieties will in the long run be supplanted and exterminated\n\nOn this doctrine of the extermination of an infinitude of connecting links\nbetween the living and extinct inhabitants of the world and at each\nsuccessive period between the extinct and still older species why is not\nevery geological formation charged with such links Why does not every\ncollection of fossil remains afford plain evidence of the gradation and\nmutation of the forms of life We meet with no such evidence and this is\nthe most obvious and forcible of the many objections which may be urged\nagainst my theory Why again do whole groups of allied species appear\nthough certainly they often falsely appear to have come in suddenly on the\nseveral geological stages Why do we not find great piles of strata beneath\nthe Silurian system stored with the remains of the progenitors of the\nSilurian groups of fossils For certainly on my theory such 464 strata\nmust somewhere have been deposited at these ancient and utterly unknown\nepochs in the worlds history\n\nI can answer these questions and grave objections only on the supposition\nthat the geological record is far more imperfect than most geologists\nbelieve It cannot be objected that there has not been time sufficient for\nany amount of organic change for the lapse of time has been so great as to\nbe utterly inappreciable by the human intellect The number of specimens in\nall our museums is absolutely as nothing compared with the countless\ngenerations of countless species which certainly have existed We should\nnot be able to recognise a species as the parent of any one or more species\nif we were to examine them ever so closely unless we likewise possessed\nmany of the intermediate links between their past or parent and present\nstates and these many links we could hardly ever expect to discover owing\nto the imperfection of the geological record Numerous existing doubtful\nforms could be named which are probably varieties but who will pretend\nthat in future ages so many fossil links will be discovered that\nnaturalists will be able to decide on the common view whether or not\nthese doubtful forms are varieties As long as most of the links between\nany two species are unknown if any one link or intermediate variety be\ndiscovered it will simply be classed as another and distinct species Only\na small portion of the world has been geologically explored Only organic\nbeings of certain classes can be preserved in a fossil condition at least\nin any great number Widely ranging species vary most and varieties are\noften at first localboth causes rendering the discovery of intermediate\nlinks less likely Local varieties will not spread into other and distant\nregions until they are considerably modified and 465 improved and when\nthey do spread if discovered in a geological formation they will appear\nas if suddenly created there and will be simply classed as new species\nMost formations have been intermittent in their accumulation and their\nduration I am inclined to believe has been shorter than the average\nduration of specific forms Successive formations are separated from each\nother by enormous blank intervals of time for fossiliferous formations\nthick enough to resist future degradation can be accumulated only where\nmuch sediment is deposited on the subsiding bed of the sea During the\nalternate periods of elevation and of stationary level the record will be\nblank During these latter periods there will probably be more variability\nin the forms of life during periods of subsidence more extinction\n\nWith respect to the absence of fossiliferous formations beneath the lowest\nSilurian strata I can only recur to the hypothesis given in the ninth\nchapter That the geological record is imperfect all will admit but that\nit is imperfect to the degree which I require few will be inclined to\nadmit If we look to long enough intervals of time geology plainly\ndeclares that all species have changed and they have changed in the manner\nwhich my theory requires for they have changed slowly and in a graduated\nmanner We clearly see this in the fossil remains from consecutive\nformations invariably being much more closely related to each other than\nare the fossils from formations distant from each other in time\n\nSuch is the sum of the several chief objections and difficulties which may\njustly be urged against my theory and I have now briefly recapitulated the\nanswers and explanations which can be given to them I have felt these\ndifficulties far too heavily during many years to 466 doubt their weight\nBut it deserves especial notice that the more important objections relate\nto questions on which we are confessedly ignorant nor do we know how\nignorant we are We do not know all the possible transitional gradations\nbetween the simplest and the most perfect organs it cannot be pretended\nthat we know all the varied means of Distribution during the long lapse of\nyears or that we know how imperfect the Geological Record is Grave as\nthese several difficulties are in my judgment they do not overthrow the\ntheory of descent from a few created forms with subsequent modification\n\n\n\nNow let us turn to the other side of the argument Under domestication we\nsee much variability This seems to be mainly due to the reproductive\nsystem being eminently susceptible to changes in the conditions of life so\nthat this system when not rendered impotent fails to reproduce offspring\nexactly like the parentform Variability is governed by many complex\nlawsby correlation of growth by use and disuse and by the direct\naction of the physical conditions of life There is much difficulty in\nascertaining how much modification our domestic productions have undergone\nbut we may safely infer that the amount has been large and that\nmodifications can be inherited for long periods As long as the conditions\nof life remain the same we have reason to believe that a modification\nwhich has already been inherited for many generations may continue to be\ninherited for an almost infinite number of generations On the other hand\nwe have evidence that variability when it has once come into play does\nnot wholly cease for new varieties are still occasionally produced by our\nmost anciently domesticated productions 467\n\nMan does not actually produce variability he only unintentionally exposes\norganic beings to new conditions of life and then nature acts on the\norganisation and causes variability But man can and does select the\nvariations given to him by nature and thus accumulate them in any desired\nmanner He thus adapts animals and plants for his own benefit or pleasure\nHe may do this methodically or he may do it unconsciously by preserving\nthe individuals most useful to him at the time without any thought of\naltering the breed It is certain that he can largely influence the\ncharacter of a breed by selecting in each successive generation\nindividual differences so slight as to be quite inappreciable by an\nuneducated eye This process of selection has been the great agency in the\nproduction of the most distinct and useful domestic breeds That many of\nthe breeds produced by man have to a large extent the character of natural\nspecies is shown by the inextricable doubts whether very many of them are\nvarieties or aboriginal species\n\nThere is no obvious reason why the principles which have acted so\nefficiently under domestication should not have acted under nature In the\npreservation of favoured individuals and races during the\nconstantlyrecurrent Struggle for Existence we see the most powerful and\neveracting means of selection The struggle for existence inevitably\nfollows from the high geometrical ratio of increase which is common to all\norganic beings This high rate of increase is proved by calculationby\nthe rapid increase of many animals and plants during a succession of\npeculiar seasons or when naturalised in a new country More individuals\nare born than can possibly survive A grain in the balance will determine\nwhich individual shall live and which shall diewhich variety or species\nshall increase in number and which 468 shall decrease or finally become\nextinct As the individuals of the same species come in all respects into\nthe closest competition with each other the struggle will generally be\nmost severe between them it will be almost equally severe between the\nvarieties of the same species and next in severity between the species of\nthe same genus But the struggle will often be very severe between beings\nmost remote in the scale of nature The slightest advantage in one being\nat any age or during any season over those with which it comes into\ncompetition or better adaptation in however slight a degree to the\nsurrounding physical conditions will turn the balance\n\nWith animals having separated sexes there will in most cases be a struggle\nbetween the males for possession of the females The most vigorous\nindividuals or those which have most successfully struggled with their\nconditions of life will generally leave most progeny But success will\noften depend on having special weapons or means of defence or on the\ncharms of the males and the slightest advantage will lead to victory\n\nAs geology plainly proclaims that each land has undergone great physical\nchanges we might have expected that organic beings would have varied under\nnature in the same way as they generally have varied under the changed\nconditions of domestication And if there be any variability under nature\nit would be an unaccountable fact if natural selection had not come into\nplay It has often been asserted but the assertion is quite incapable of\nproof that the amount of variation under nature is a strictly limited\nquantity Man though acting on external characters alone and often\ncapriciously can produce within a short period a great result by adding up\nmere individual differences in his domestic productions and every one\nadmits that there are at least individual differences in species under\n469 nature But besides such differences all naturalists have admitted\nthe existence of varieties which they think sufficiently distinct to be\nworthy of record in systematic works No one can draw any clear distinction\nbetween individual differences and slight varieties or between more\nplainly marked varieties and subspecies and species Let it be observed\nhow naturalists differ in the rank which they assign to the many\nrepresentative forms in Europe and North America\n\nIf then we have under nature variability and a powerful agent always ready\nto act and select why should we doubt that variations in any way useful to\nbeings under their excessively complex relations of life would be\npreserved accumulated and inherited Why if man can by patience select\nvariations most useful to himself should nature fail in selecting\nvariations useful under changing conditions of life to her living\nproducts What limit can be put to this power acting during long ages and\nrigidly scrutinising the whole constitution structure and habits of each\ncreaturefavouring the good and rejecting the bad I can see no limit to\nthis power in slowly and beautifully adapting each form to the most\ncomplex relations of life The theory of natural selection even if we\nlooked no further than this seems to me to be in itself probable I have\nalready recapitulated as fairly as I could the opposed difficulties and\nobjections: now let us turn to the special facts and arguments in favour of\nthe theory\n\nOn the view that species are only strongly marked and permanent varieties\nand that each species first existed as a variety we can see why it is that\nno line of demarcation can be drawn between species commonly supposed to\nhave been produced by special acts of creation and varieties which are\nacknowledged to have been produced by secondary laws On this same 470\nview we can understand how it is that in each region where many species of\na genus have been produced and where they now flourish these same species\nshould present many varieties for where the manufactory of species has\nbeen active we might expect as a general rule to find it still in\naction and this is the case if varieties be incipient species Moreover\nthe species of the larger genera which afford the greater number of\nvarieties or incipient species retain to a certain degree the character of\nvarieties for they differ from each other by a less amount of difference\nthan do the species of smaller genera The closely allied species also of\nthe larger genera apparently have restricted ranges and in their\naffinities they are clustered in little groups round other speciesin\nwhich respects they resemble varieties These are strange relations on the\nview of each species having been independently created but are\nintelligible if all species first existed as varieties\n\nAs each species tends by its geometrical ratio of reproduction to increase\ninordinately in number and as the modified descendants of each species\nwill be enabled to increase by so much the more as they become diversified\nin habits and structure so as to be enabled to seize on many and widely\ndifferent places in the economy of nature there will be a constant\ntendency in natural selection to preserve the most divergent offspring of\nany one species Hence during a longcontinued course of modification the\nslight differences characteristic of varieties of the same species tend\nto be augmented into the greater differences characteristic of species of\nthe same genus New and improved varieties will inevitably supplant and\nexterminate the older less improved and intermediate varieties and thus\nspecies are rendered to a large extent defined and distinct objects\nDominant species belonging to the 471 larger groups tend to give birth to\nnew and dominant forms so that each large group tends to become still\nlarger and at the same time more divergent in character But as all groups\ncannot thus succeed in increasing in size for the world would not hold\nthem the more dominant groups beat the less dominant This tendency in the\nlarge groups to go on increasing in size and diverging in character\ntogether with the almost inevitable contingency of much extinction\nexplains the arrangement of all the forms of life in groups subordinate to\ngroups all within a few great classes which we now see everywhere around\nus and which has prevailed throughout all time This grand fact of the\ngrouping of all organic beings seems to me utterly inexplicable on the\ntheory of creation\n\nAs natural selection acts solely by accumulating slight successive\nfavourable variations it can produce no great or sudden modification it\ncan act only by very short and slow steps Hence the canon of Natura non\nfacit saltum which every fresh addition to our knowledge tends to make\ntruer is on this theory simply intelligible We can plainly see why nature\nis prodigal in variety though niggard in innovation But why this should\nbe a law of nature if each species has been independently created no man\ncan explain\n\nMany other facts are as it seems to me explicable on this theory How\nstrange it is that a bird under the form of woodpecker should have been\ncreated to prey on insects on the ground that upland geese which never or\nrarely swim should have been created with webbed feet that a thrush\nshould have been created to dive and feed on subaquatic insects and that\na petrel should have been created with habits and structure fitting it for\nthe life of an auk or grebe and so on in endless other cases But on the\nview of each 472 species constantly trying to increase in number with\nnatural selection always ready to adapt the slowly varying descendants of\neach to any unoccupied or illoccupied place in nature these facts cease\nto be strange or perhaps might even have been anticipated\n\nAs natural selection acts by competition it adapts the inhabitants of each\ncountry only in relation to the degree of perfection of their associates\nso that we need feel no surprise at the inhabitants of any one country\nalthough on the ordinary view supposed to have been specially created and\nadapted for that country being beaten and supplanted by the naturalised\nproductions from another land Nor ought we to marvel if all the\ncontrivances in nature be not as far as we can judge absolutely perfect\nand if some of them be abhorrent to our ideas of fitness We need not\nmarvel at the sting of the bee causing the bees own death at drones being\nproduced in such vast numbers for one single act with the great majority\nslaughtered by their sterile sisters at the astonishing waste of pollen by\nour firtrees at the instinctive hatred of the queen bee for her own\nfertile daughters at ichneumonid feeding within the live bodies of\ncaterpillars and at other such cases The wonder indeed is on the theory\nof natural selection that more cases of the want of absolute perfection\nhave not been observed\n\nThe complex and little known laws governing variation are the same as far\nas we can see with the laws which have governed the production of\nsocalled specific forms In both cases physical conditions seem to have\nproduced but little direct effect yet when varieties enter any zone they\noccasionally assume some of the characters of the species proper to that\nzone In both varieties and species use and disuse seem to have produced\nsome effect for it is difficult to resist this 473 conclusion when we\nlook for instance at the loggerheaded duck which has wings incapable of\nflight in nearly the same condition as in the domestic duck or when we\nlook at the burrowing tucutucu which is occasionally blind and then at\ncertain moles which are habitually blind and have their eyes covered with\nskin or when we look at the blind animals inhabiting the dark caves of\nAmerica and Europe In both varieties and species correlation of growth\nseems to have played a most important part so that when one part has been\nmodified other parts are necessarily modified In both varieties and\nspecies reversions to longlost characters occur How inexplicable on the\ntheory of creation is the occasional appearance of stripes on the shoulder\nand legs of the several species of the horsegenus and in their hybrids\nHow simply is this fact explained if we believe that these species have\ndescended from a striped progenitor in the same manner as the several\ndomestic breeds of pigeon have descended from the blue and barred\nrockpigeon\n\nOn the ordinary view of each species having been independently created why\nshould the specific characters or those by which the species of the same\ngenus differ from each other be more variable than the generic characters\nin which they all agree Why for instance should the colour of a flower\nbe more likely to vary in any one species of a genus if the other species\nsupposed to have been created independently have differently coloured\nflowers than if all the species of the genus have the same coloured\nflowers If species are only wellmarked varieties of which the characters\nhave become in a high degree permanent we can understand this fact for\nthey have already varied since they branched off from a common progenitor\nin certain characters by which they have come to be specifically distinct\nfrom each other 474 and therefore these same characters would be more\nlikely still to be variable than the generic characters which have been\ninherited without change for an enormous period It is inexplicable on the\ntheory of creation why a part developed in a very unusual manner in any one\nspecies of a genus and therefore as we may naturally infer of great\nimportance to the species should be eminently liable to variation but on\nmy view this part has undergone since the several species branched off\nfrom a common progenitor an unusual amount of variability and\nmodification and therefore we might expect this part generally to be still\nvariable But a part may be developed in the most unusual manner like the\nwing of a bat and yet not be more variable than any other structure if\nthe part be common to many subordinate forms that is if it has been\ninherited for a very long period for in this case it will have been\nrendered constant by longcontinued natural selection\n\nGlancing at instincts marvellous as some are they offer no greater\ndifficulty than does corporeal structure on the theory of the natural\nselection of successive slight but profitable modifications We can thus\nunderstand why nature moves by graduated steps in endowing different\nanimals of the same class with their several instincts I have attempted to\nshow how much light the principle of gradation throws on the admirable\narchitectural powers of the hivebee Habit no doubt sometimes comes into\nplay in modifying instincts but it certainly is not indispensable as we\nsee in the case of neuter insects which leave no progeny to inherit the\neffects of longcontinued habit On the view of all the species of the same\ngenus having descended from a common parent and having inherited much in\ncommon we can understand how it is that allied species when placed under\nconsiderably different conditions of life 475 yet should follow nearly\nthe same instincts why the thrush of South America for instance lines\nher nest with mud like our British species On the view of instincts having\nbeen slowly acquired through natural selection we need not marvel at some\ninstincts being apparently not perfect and liable to mistakes and at many\ninstincts causing other animals to suffer\n\nIf species be only wellmarked and permanent varieties we can at once see\nwhy their crossed offspring should follow the same complex laws in their\ndegrees and kinds of resemblance to their parentsin being absorbed into\neach other by successive crosses and in other such pointsas do the\ncrossed offspring of acknowledged varieties On the other hand these would\nbe strange facts if species have been independently created and varieties\nhave been produced by secondary laws\n\nIf we admit that the geological record is imperfect in an extreme degree\nthen such facts as the record gives support the theory of descent with\nmodification New species have come on the stage slowly and at successive\nintervals and the amount of change after equal intervals of time is\nwidely different in different groups The extinction of species and of\nwhole groups of species which has played so conspicuous a part in the\nhistory of the organic world almost inevitably follows on the principle of\nnatural selection for old forms will be supplanted by new and improved\nforms Neither single species nor groups of species reappear when the chain\nof ordinary generation has once been broken The gradual diffusion of\ndominant forms with the slow modification of their descendants causes the\nforms of life after long intervals of time to appear as if they had\nchanged simultaneously throughout the world The fact of the fossil remains\nof each formation being in some degree intermediate in character between\nthe 476 fossils in the formations above and below is simply explained by\ntheir intermediate position in the chain of descent The grand fact that\nall extinct organic beings belong to the same system with recent beings\nfalling either into the same or into intermediate groups follows from the\nliving and the extinct being the offspring of common parents As the groups\nwhich have descended from an ancient progenitor have generally diverged in\ncharacter the progenitor with its early descendants will often be\nintermediate in character in comparison with its later descendants and\nthus we can see why the more ancient a fossil is the oftener it stands in\nsome degree intermediate between existing and allied groups Recent forms\nare generally looked at as being in some vague sense higher than ancient\nand extinct forms and they are in so far higher as the later and more\nimproved forms have conquered the older and less improved organic beings in\nthe struggle for life Lastly the law of the long endurance of allied\nforms on the same continentof marsupials in Australia of edentata in\nAmerica and other such casesis intelligible for within a confined\ncountry the recent and the extinct will naturally be allied by descent\n\nLooking to geographical distribution if we admit that there has been\nduring the long course of ages much migration from one part of the world to\nanother owing to former climatal and geographical changes and to the many\noccasional and unknown means of dispersal then we can understand on the\ntheory of descent with modification most of the great leading facts in\nDistribution We can see why there should be so striking a parallelism in\nthe distribution of organic beings throughout space and in their\ngeological succession throughout time for in both cases the beings have\nbeen connected by the bond of ordinary generation and the means of 477\nmodification have been the same We see the full meaning of the wonderful\nfact which must have struck every traveller namely that on the same\ncontinent under the most diverse conditions under heat and cold on\nmountain and lowland on deserts and marshes most of the inhabitants\nwithin each great class are plainly related for they will generally be\ndescendants of the same progenitors and early colonists On this same\nprinciple of former migration combined in most cases with modification we\ncan understand by the aid of the Glacial period the identity of some few\nplants and the close alliance of many others on the most distant\nmountains under the most different climates and likewise the close\nalliance of some of the inhabitants of the sea in the northern and southern\ntemperate zones though separated by the whole intertropical ocean\nAlthough two areas may present the same physical conditions of life we\nneed feel no surprise at their inhabitants being widely different if they\nhave been for a long period completely separated from each other for as\nthe relation of organism to organism is the most important of all\nrelations and as the two areas will have received colonists from some\nthird source or from each other at various periods and in different\nproportions the course of modification in the two areas will inevitably be\ndifferent\n\nOn this view of migration with subsequent modification we can see why\noceanic islands should be inhabited by few species but of these that many\nshould be peculiar We can clearly see why those animals which cannot cross\nwide spaces of ocean as frogs and terrestrial mammals should not inhabit\noceanic islands and why on the other hand new and peculiar species of\nbats which can traverse the ocean should so often be found on islands far\ndistant from any continent Such facts 478 as the presence of peculiar\nspecies of bats and the absence of all other mammals on oceanic islands\nare utterly inexplicable on the theory of independent acts of creation\n\nThe existence of closely allied or representative species in any two areas\nimplies on the theory of descent with modification that the same parents\nformerly inhabited both areas and we almost invariably find that wherever\nmany closely allied species inhabit two areas some identical species\ncommon to both still exist Wherever many closely allied yet distinct\nspecies occur many doubtful forms and varieties of the same species\nlikewise occur It is a rule of high generality that the inhabitants of\neach area are related to the inhabitants of the nearest source whence\nimmigrants might have been derived We see this in nearly all the plants\nand animals of the Galapagos archipelago of Juan Fernandez and of the\nother American islands being related in the most striking manner to the\nplants and animals of the neighbouring American mainland and those of the\nCape de Verde archipelago and other African islands to the African\nmainland It must be admitted that these facts receive no explanation on\nthe theory of creation\n\nThe fact as we have seen that all past and present organic beings\nconstitute one grand natural system with group subordinate to group and\nwith extinct groups often falling in between recent groups is intelligible\non the theory of natural selection with its contingencies of extinction and\ndivergence of character On these same principles we see how it is that\nthe mutual affinities of the species and genera within each class are so\ncomplex and circuitous We see why certain characters are far more\nserviceable than others for classificationwhy adaptive characters\nthough of paramount importance to the being are of hardly any 479\nimportance in classification why characters derived from rudimentary\nparts though of no service to the being are often of high classificatory\nvalue and why embryological characters are the most valuable of all The\nreal affinities of all organic beings are due to inheritance or community\nof descent The natural system is a genealogical arrangement in which we\nhave to discover the lines of descent by the most permanent characters\nhowever slight their vital importance may be\n\nThe framework of bones being the same in the hand of a man wing of a bat\nfin of the porpoise and leg of the horsethe same number of vertebr\nforming the neck of the giraffe and of the elephantand innumerable other\nsuch facts at once explain themselves on the theory of descent with slow\nand slight successive modifications The similarity of pattern in the wing\nand leg of a bat though used for such different purposein the jaws and\nlegs of a crabin the petals stamens and pistils of a flower is\nlikewise intelligible on the view of the gradual modification of parts or\norgans which were alike in the early progenitor of each class On the\nprinciple of successive variations not always supervening at an early age\nand being inherited at a corresponding not early period of life we can\nclearly see why the embryos of mammals birds reptiles and fishes should\nbe so closely alike and should be so unlike the adult forms We may cease\nmarvelling at the embryo of an airbreathing mammal or bird having\nbranchial slits and arteries running in loops like those in a fish which\nhas to breathe the air dissolved in water by the aid of welldeveloped\nbranchi\n\nDisuse aided sometimes by natural selection will often tend to reduce an\norgan when it has become useless by changed habits or under changed\nconditions 480 of life and we can clearly understand on this view the\nmeaning of rudimentary organs But disuse and selection will generally act\non each creature when it has come to maturity and has to play its full\npart in the struggle for existence and will thus have little power of\nacting on an organ during early life hence the organ will not be much\nreduced or rendered rudimentary at this early age The calf for instance\nhas inherited teeth which never cut through the gums of the upper jaw\nfrom an early progenitor having welldeveloped teeth and we may believe\nthat the teeth in the mature animal were reduced during successive\ngenerations by disuse or by the tongue and palate having been better\nfitted by natural selection to browse without their aid whereas in the\ncalf the teeth have been left untouched by selection or disuse and on the\nprinciple of inheritance at corresponding ages have been inherited from a\nremote period to the present day On the view of each organic being and\neach separate organ having been specially created how utterly inexplicable\nit is that parts like the teeth in the embryonic calf or like the\nshrivelled wings under the soldered wingcovers of some beetles should\nthus so frequently bear the plain stamp of inutility Nature may be said to\nhave taken pains to reveal by rudimentary organs and by homologous\nstructures her scheme of modification which it seems that we wilfully\nwill not understand\n\n\n\nI have now recapitulated the chief facts and considerations which have\nthoroughly convinced me that species have been modified during a long\ncourse of descent by the preservation or the natural selection of many\nsuccessive slight favourable variations I cannot believe that a false\ntheory would explain as it seems to me that the theory of natural\nselection does explain 481 the several large classes of facts above\nspecified I see no good reason why the views given in this volume should\nshock the religious feelings of any one A celebrated author and divine has\nwritten to me that he has gradually learnt to see that it is just as noble\na conception of the Deity to believe that He created a few original forms\ncapable of selfdevelopment into other and needful forms as to believe\nthat He required a fresh act of creation to supply the voids caused by the\naction of His laws\n\nWhy it may be asked have all the most eminent living naturalists and\ngeologists rejected this view of the mutability of species It cannot be\nasserted that organic beings in a state of nature are subject to no\nvariation it cannot be proved that the amount of variation in the course\nof long ages is a limited quantity no clear distinction has been or can\nbe drawn between species and wellmarked varieties It cannot be\nmaintained that species when intercrossed are invariably sterile and\nvarieties invariably fertile or that sterility is a special endowment and\nsign of creation The belief that species were immutable productions was\nalmost unavoidable as long as the history of the world was thought to be of\nshort duration and now that we have acquired some idea of the lapse of\ntime we are too apt to assume without proof that the geological record\nis so perfect that it would have afforded us plain evidence of the mutation\nof species if they had undergone mutation\n\nBut the chief cause of our natural unwillingness to admit that one species\nhas given birth to other and distinct species is that we are always slow\nin admitting any great change of which we do not see the intermediate\nsteps The difficulty is the same as that felt by so many geologists when\nLyell first insisted that long 482 lines of inland cliffs had been\nformed and great valleys excavated by the slow action of the coastwaves\nThe mind cannot possibly grasp the full meaning of the term of a hundred\nmillion years it cannot add up and perceive the full effects of many\nslight variations accumulated during an almost infinite number of\ngenerations\n\nAlthough I am fully convinced of the truth of the views given in this\nvolume under the form of an abstract I by no means expect to convince\nexperienced naturalists whose minds are stocked with a multitude of facts\nall viewed during a long course of years from a point of view directly\nopposite to mine It is so easy to hide our ignorance under such\nexpressions as the plan of creation unity of design c and to think\nthat we give an explanation when we only restate a fact Any one whose\ndisposition leads him to attach more weight to unexplained difficulties\nthan to the explanation of a certain number of facts will certainly reject\nmy theory A few naturalists endowed with much flexibility of mind and\nwho have already begun to doubt on the immutability of species may be\ninfluenced by this volume but I look with confidence to the future to\nyoung and rising naturalists who will be able to view both sides of the\nquestion with impartiality Whoever is led to believe that species are\nmutable will do good service by conscientiously expressing his conviction\nfor only thus can the load of prejudice by which this subject is\noverwhelmed be removed\n\nSeveral eminent naturalists have of late published their belief that a\nmultitude of reputed species in each genus are not real species but that\nother species are real that is have been independently created This\nseems to me a strange conclusion to arrive at They admit that a multitude\nof forms which till lately 483 they themselves thought were special\ncreations and which are still thus looked at by the majority of\nnaturalists and which consequently have every external characteristic\nfeature of true speciesthey admit that these have been produced by\nvariation but they refuse to extend the same view to other and very\nslightly different forms Nevertheless they do not pretend that they can\ndefine or even conjecture which are the created forms of life and which\nare those produced by secondary laws They admit variation as a vera\ncausa in one case they arbitrarily reject it in another without\nassigning any distinction in the two cases The day will come when this\nwill be given as a curious illustration of the blindness of preconceived\nopinion These authors seem no more startled at a miraculous act of\ncreation than at an ordinary birth But do they really believe that at\ninnumerable periods in the earths history certain elemental atoms have\nbeen commanded suddenly to flash into living tissues Do they believe that\nat each supposed act of creation one individual or many were produced Were\nall the infinitely numerous kinds of animals and plants created as eggs or\nseed or as full grown and in the case of mammals were they created\nbearing the false marks of nourishment from the mothers womb Although\nnaturalists very properly demand a full explanation of every difficulty\nfrom those who believe in the mutability of species on their own side they\nignore the whole subject of the first appearance of species in what they\nconsider reverent silence\n\nIt may be asked how far I extend the doctrine of the modification of\nspecies The question is difficult to answer because the more distinct the\nforms are which we may consider by so much the arguments fall away in\nforce But some arguments of the greatest weight 484 extend very far All\nthe members of whole classes can be connected together by chains of\naffinities and all can be classified on the same principle in groups\nsubordinate to groups Fossil remains sometimes tend to fill up very wide\nintervals between existing orders Organs in a rudimentary condition\nplainly show that an early progenitor had the organ in a fully developed\nstate and this in some instances necessarily implies an enormous amount of\nmodification in the descendants Throughout whole classes various\nstructures are formed on the same pattern and at an embryonic age the\nspecies closely resemble each other Therefore I cannot doubt that the\ntheory of descent with modification embraces all the members of the same\nclass I believe that animals have descended from at most only four or five\nprogenitors and plants from an equal or lesser number\n\nAnalogy would lead me one step further namely to the belief that all\nanimals and plants have descended from some one prototype But analogy may\nbe a deceitful guide Nevertheless all living things have much in common\nin their chemical composition their germinal vesicles their cellular\nstructure and their laws of growth and reproduction We see this even in\nso trifling a circumstance as that the same poison often similarly affects\nplants and animals or that the poison secreted by the gallfly produces\nmonstrous growths on the wild rose or oaktree Therefore I should infer\nfrom analogy that probably all the organic beings which have ever lived on\nthis earth have descended from some one primordial form into which life\nwas first breathed by the Creator\n\n\n\nWhen the views advanced by me in this volume and by Mr Wallace in the\nLinnean Journal or when analogous views on the origin of species are\ngenerally 485 admitted we can dimly foresee that there will be a\nconsiderable revolution in natural history Systematists will be able to\npursue their labours as at present but they will not be incessantly\nhaunted by the shadowy doubt whether this or that form be in essence a\nspecies This I feel sure and I speak after experience will be no slight\nrelief The endless disputes whether or not some fifty species of British\nbrambles are true species will cease Systematists will have only to decide\nnot that this will be easy whether any form be sufficiently constant and\ndistinct from other forms to be capable of definition and if definable\nwhether the differences be sufficiently important to deserve a specific\nname This latter point will become a far more essential consideration than\nit is at present for differences however slight between any two forms\nif not blended by intermediate gradations are looked at by most\nnaturalists as sufficient to raise both forms to the rank of species\nHereafter we shall be compelled to acknowledge that the only distinction\nbetween species and wellmarked varieties is that the latter are known or\nbelieved to be connected at the present day by intermediate gradations\nwhereas species were formerly thus connected Hence without rejecting the\nconsideration of the present existence of intermediate gradations between\nany two forms we shall be led to weigh more carefully and to value higher\nthe actual amount of difference between them It is quite possible that\nforms now generally acknowledged to be merely varieties may hereafter be\nthought worthy of specific names as with the primrose and cowslip and in\nthis case scientific and common language will come into accordance In\nshort we shall have to treat species in the same manner as those\nnaturalists treat genera who admit that genera are merely artificial\ncombinations 486 made for convenience This may not be a cheering\nprospect but we shall at least be freed from the vain search for the\nundiscovered and undiscoverable essence of the term species\n\nThe other and more general departments of natural history will rise greatly\nin interest The terms used by naturalists of affinity relationship\ncommunity of type paternity morphology adaptive characters rudimentary\nand aborted organs c will cease to be metaphorical and will have a\nplain signification When we no longer look at an organic being as a savage\nlooks at a ship as at something wholly beyond his comprehension when we\nregard every production of nature as one which has had a history when we\ncontemplate every complex structure and instinct as the summing up of many\ncontrivances each useful to the possessor nearly in the same way as when\nwe look at any great mechanical invention as the summing up of the labour\nthe experience the reason and even the blunders of numerous workmen when\nwe thus view each organic being how far more interesting I speak from\nexperience will the study of natural history become\n\nA grand and almost untrodden field of inquiry will be opened on the causes\nand laws of variation on correlation of growth on the effects of use and\ndisuse on the direct action of external conditions and so forth The\nstudy of domestic productions will rise immensely in value A new variety\nraised by man will be a more important and interesting subject for study\nthan one more species added to the infinitude of already recorded species\nOur classifications will come to be as far as they can be so made\ngenealogies and will then truly give what may be called the plan of\ncreation The rules for classifying will no doubt become simpler when we\nhave a definite object in view We possess no 487 pedigrees or armorial\nbearings and we have to discover and trace the many diverging lines of\ndescent in our natural genealogies by characters of any kind which have\nlong been inherited Rudimentary organs will speak infallibly with respect\nto the nature of longlost structures Species and groups of species which\nare called aberrant and which may fancifully be called living fossils\nwill aid us in forming a picture of the ancient forms of life Embryology\nwill reveal to us the structure in some degree obscured of the prototypes\nof each great class\n\nWhen we can feel assured that all the individuals of the same species and\nall the closely allied species of most genera have within a not very\nremote period descended from one parent and have migrated from some one\nbirthplace and when we better know the many means of migration then by\nthe light which geology now throws and will continue to throw on former\nchanges of climate and of the level of the land we shall surely be enabled\nto trace in an admirable manner the former migrations of the inhabitants of\nthe whole world Even at present by comparing the differences of the\ninhabitants of the sea on the opposite sides of a continent and the nature\nof the various inhabitants of that continent in relation to their apparent\nmeans of immigration some light can be thrown on ancient geography\n\nThe noble science of Geology loses glory from the extreme imperfection of\nthe record The crust of the earth with its embedded remains must not be\nlooked at as a wellfilled museum but as a poor collection made at hazard\nand at rare intervals The accumulation of each great fossiliferous\nformation will be recognised as having depended on an unusual concurrence\nof circumstances and the blank intervals between the successive stages as\nhaving been of vast duration But we shall 488 be able to gauge with some\nsecurity the duration of these intervals by a comparison of the preceding\nand succeeding organic forms We must be cautious in attempting to\ncorrelate as strictly contemporaneous two formations which include few\nidentical species by the general succession of their forms of life As\nspecies are produced and exterminated by slowly acting and still existing\ncauses and not by miraculous acts of creation and by catastrophes and as\nthe most important of all causes of organic change is one which is almost\nindependent of altered and perhaps suddenly altered physical conditions\nnamely the mutual relation of organism to organismthe improvement of\none being entailing the improvement or the extermination of others it\nfollows that the amount of organic change in the fossils of consecutive\nformations probably serves as a fair measure of the lapse of actual time A\nnumber of species however keeping in a body might remain for a long\nperiod unchanged whilst within this same period several of these species\nby migrating into new countries and coming into competition with foreign\nassociates might become modified so that we must not overrate the\naccuracy of organic change as a measure of time During early periods of\nthe earths history when the forms of life were probably fewer and\nsimpler the rate of change was probably slower and at the first dawn of\nlife when very few forms of the simplest structure existed the rate of\nchange may have been slow in an extreme degree The whole history of the\nworld as at present known although of a length quite incomprehensible by\nus will hereafter be recognised as a mere fragment of time compared with\nthe ages which have elapsed since the first creature the progenitor of\ninnumerable extinct and living descendants was created\n\nIn the distant future I see open fields for far more 489 important\nresearches Psychology will be based on a new foundation that of the\nnecessary acquirement of each mental power and capacity by gradation Light\nwill be thrown on the origin of man and his history\n\nAuthors of the highest eminence seem to be fully satisfied with the view\nthat each species has been independently created To my mind it accords\nbetter with what we know of the laws impressed on matter by the Creator\nthat the production and extinction of the past and present inhabitants of\nthe world should have been due to secondary causes like those determining\nthe birth and death of the individual When I view all beings not as\nspecial creations but as the lineal descendants of some few beings which\nlived long before the first bed of the Silurian system was deposited they\nseem to me to become ennobled Judging from the past we may safely infer\nthat not one living species will transmit its unaltered likeness to a\ndistant futurity And of the species now living very few will transmit\nprogeny of any kind to a far distant futurity for the manner in which all\norganic beings are grouped shows that the greater number of species of\neach genus and all the species of many genera have left no descendants\nbut have become utterly extinct We can so far take a prophetic glance into\nfuturity as to foretel that it will be the common and widelyspread\nspecies belonging to the larger and dominant groups which will ultimately\nprevail and procreate new and dominant species As all the living forms of\nlife are the lineal descendants of those which lived long before the\nSilurian epoch we may feel certain that the ordinary succession by\ngeneration has never once been broken and that no cataclysm has desolated\nthe whole world Hence we may look with some confidence to a secure future\nof equally inappreciable length And as natural selection works 490\nsolely by and for the good of each being all corporeal and mental\nendowments will tend to progress towards perfection\n\nIt is interesting to contemplate an entangled bank clothed with many\nplants of many kinds with birds singing on the bushes with various\ninsects flitting about and with worms crawling through the damp earth and\nto reflect that these elaborately constructed forms so different from each\nother and dependent on each other in so complex a manner have all been\nproduced by laws acting around us These laws taken in the largest sense\nbeing Growth with Reproduction Inheritance which is almost implied by\nreproduction Variability from the indirect and direct action of the\nexternal conditions of life and from use and disuse a Ratio of Increase\nso high as to lead to a Struggle for Life and as a consequence to Natural\nSelection entailing Divergence of Character and the Extinction of\nlessimproved forms Thus from the war of nature from famine and death\nthe most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving namely the\nproduction of the higher animals directly follows There is grandeur in\nthis view of life with its several powers having been originally breathed\nby the Creator into a few forms or into one and that whilst this planet\nhas gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity from so simple a\nbeginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been and\nare being evolved\n\n                                   \n\n\n491\n\nINDEX\n\n          A\n\n  Aberrant groups 429\n

Which books have similar content?\n<p>This turns out to be extremely useful if we want to determine a given book's most similar work. For example, we have just seen that if you enjoyed \"<em>On the Origin of Species</em>,\" you can read books discussing similar concepts such as \"<em>The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication</em>\" or \"<em>The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex</em>.\" If you are familiar with Darwin's work, these suggestions will likely seem natural to you. Indeed, <em>On the Origin of Species</em> has a whole chapter about domestication and <em>The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex</em> applies the theory of natural selection to human evolution. Hence, the results make sense.</p>\n<p>However, we now want to have a better understanding of the big picture and see how Darwin's books are generally related to each other (in terms of topics discussed). To this purpose, we will represent the whole similarity matrix as a dendrogram, which is a standard tool to display such data. <strong>This last approach will display all the information about book similarities at once.</strong> For example, we can find a book's closest relative but, also, we can visualize which groups of books have similar topics (e.g., the cluster about Charles Darwin personal life with his autobiography and letters). If you are familiar with Darwin's bibliography, the results should not surprise you too much, which indicates the method gives good results. Otherwise, next time you read one of the author's book, you will know which other books to read next in order to learn more about the topics it
